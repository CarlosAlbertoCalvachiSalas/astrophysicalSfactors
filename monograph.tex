Writing strategies.

Kind of paragraphs to be used:

This is a short workshop on writing when the intention is to template and organize ideas. 

Writing can be useful for doing the organizing exercise so it is just natural to use it directly when approaching the actual text to be intervened. 

As it is natural, a hierarchy is given in the organization of ideas. However, paragraph gluing might not follow the same standards as idea production, or it can be similar in some circumstances. 

I like to classify the kind of paragraphs to be encountered in this text:

\section{Elements of quantum mechanics for nuclear physics} \label{sec:quantumMechanics}


Quantum mechanics governs the physics at the nuclear scale. In particular, some elements of quantum mechanics theory that are essential for the description of nuclear reactions. For instance, quantum mechanical treatment of scattering theory is critical for determining the behavior of the rates of the reaction. In addition, tunneling phenomena, which can only be explained from the non-classical behavior of nuclear physics, permits the existence of nuclear fusion. Finally, transition phenomena will be considered in this section from the point of view of electromagnetic transitions.

\subsection{Scattering theory} \label{sub:scatteringTheory}

%  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.1995.pdf EXAMINATION OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL S-FACTORS OF THE RADIATIVE PROTON CAPTURE ON 2H, 6Li, 7Li, 12C AND 13C  (cluster method)

Explain scattering theory relevant for the understanding of  processes. \\

The sequence of the calculations on scattering is the following
-	Consider free path approximation -> Bessel Function solution  
-	Expand free wave in terms of Bessel and Harmonic oscillator solutions
-	Obtain the coefficients of the expansion 
-	Evaluate asymptotic behavior at $r \rightarrow \infty$

When considering a potential, it appears that the oscillatory asymptotic wave function is shifted $e^{2i\delta_l}$. This factor depends on the angular momentum $l$. This directly relates with differential cross sections. \\

A reference text on collision theory \cite{joachain_1983}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:crossSection_definition}
	\sigma  = \frac{\mathrm{scattered \ per \ time}}{(\mathrm{incident \ per \ time \ per \ area} )(\mathrm{total \ nuclei})}.
\end{equation}

Cross sections are probabilities 
The probabilities are ruled by the laws of scattering theory, which can be understood as a subpart of quantum mechanics. 

There is of interest the differential cross section. Particularly, there is a connection with quantum mechanics scattering amplitudes with the formula


Cross section -> Reciprocal factors -> Scattering potentials -> Coloumb Barrier (With WKB approximation) -> Breit - Weigner formula (This is for resonant behavior)-> S factors, ... \\ 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:scattering_Schrodinger_general}
	i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi (\vec r, t)= \hat H \Psi (\vec r, t).
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:scattering_Schrodinger_timeIndependent}
	-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi (\vec r) + V \psi (\vec r)  = E \psi (\vec r) .
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:scattering_Schrodinger_separationVariables}
	\psi(\vec r) = u(r) Y(\theta, \phi).
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:scattering_Schrodinger_separationVariables_angular}
	Y(\theta, \phi) = \Theta (\theta) \Phi (\phi).
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:scattering_Schrodinger_separationVariables_radial}
	- \frac{\hbar^2}{2 \mu}u''(r)  + u(r) \left( V(r)  - \frac{\hbar^2l(l+1)}{2 \mu r^2}  \right  ) = E u(r).
\end{equation}

There are several contributions  to the total rate. There are four in principal 
Broad resonances, thin resonances, continuum, nonresonant.

Scattering theory develops from the method of partial waves. It roughly consists on solving for the SchÃ¶dinger equation in free space and, with the potential given, expand in terms of an orthonormal basis of functions, like spherical Bessel and Neumann functions and spherical harmonics. Then, conditions are adjusted via boundary condition satisfying. \\

\subsubsection{Partial wave expansion}

Initially, incident particles are modeled as plane waves since they are sufficiently far from the region of action of the interaction potential. Therefore, the ingoing wavefunction is exemplified by: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:scattering_waveFunction_incident}
	\psi_{-}(\vec r) \rightarrow A e^{ikz}, 
\end{equation}

where $A$, $k$, $z$ correspond to the amplitude, wave-number and displacement of the wave respectively. The selection of the $+z$ axis as the preferred axis obeys literature conventions. \\

Subsequently, when the particle gets scattered, the outgoing wavefunction $\psi_{+}(\vec r)$ accounts for the changes of the state of the system after the scattering process. In the case of $r \rightarrow \infty$, the wavefunction approaches to:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:scattering_waveFunction_outgoing}
	\psi_{+}(\vec r) \rightarrow \frac{f(\theta, \phi)}{r} e^{i k r}, 
\end{equation}

where $f(\theta, \phi)$ corresponds to the scattering amplitude, which is proportional to the amplitude of the radial-wave contribution of equation \ref{eq:scattering_waveFunction_outgoing}. This term has physical relevance since it is closely connected to the details of the interaction that causes the scattering. In particular, it has a connection with the differential cross section $d\sigma / d\Omega$, which is expressed as: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:scattering_diffCrossSection}
	\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = |f(\theta, \phi)|^2
\end{equation}

With this picture given, the entire wave function $\psi(\vec r)$ is approximated as the sum of the ingoing and outgoing contributions of equations \ref{eq:scattering_waveFunction_incident} and  \ref{eq:scattering_waveFunction_outgoing} as expressed in: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:scattering_waveFunction_ansatz}
	\psi(\vec r) = 	\psi_{-}(\vec r) + \psi_{+}(\vec r).
\end{equation}

it is sufficient to determine the constant $A$ and the differential cross section to fully describe the scattered system. On the one hand, the constant $A$ can be determined by normalization. On the other hand, the differential cross section, or its related quantities like the cross section, are determined by a wide variety of methods, which are expanded in Chapter \ref{ch:sfactorModels}. On the other hand, constant $A$ can be determined by matching appropriate boundary conditions. \\

As a first step towards the constant determination is the expansion of the incident term in equation \ref{eq:scattering_waveFunction_incident} in terms of a linear combination of a convenient basis that actually solves the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. For the case of $V = 0$, which happens at $r \rightarrow \infty$, the angular contribution of the wave function can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics $Y_{m}^{l}(\theta, \phi)$ and the radial contribution in terms of Bessel functions $j_l(kr)$ as given by:

\begin{equation}   \label{eq:partialWaveExpansion_definition}
	\psi(r, \theta, \phi) =  \sum_{l} \sum_{m} {c_{lm}Y_{m}^{l}(\theta, \phi)j_l(kr)}
\end{equation}

Then, the plane wave contribution to equation \ref{eq:scattering_waveFunction_outgoing}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:scattering_planeWave_expansion}
	e^{ikz} = 4\pi  \sum_{l = 0}^{\infty}  \sum_{m = -l}^{m=l} { i^l Y^{l}_{m}(\theta, \phi) j_l(kr)}.
\end{equation}


Free space solution with $j_l(kr)$ the spherical Bessel function of $l$ parameter. There are also the $n_l(kr)$ Neumann function and the Hankel functions $h^{(1)}(kr)$ and $h^{(2)}(kr)$ functions.

A result that relates cross sections and the probability current density is the  theorem. 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:crossSection_opticalTheorem}
	\sigma = \frac{4 \pi }{k} \mathrm{Im}(f(\theta = 0)))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:crossSection_Smatrix_definition}
	S_l = 1 - e^{2i\delta_l}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:crossSection_Smatrix_relation}
	\sigma \propto \sum_{l} (2l + 1) |S_l|^2. 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Born approximation}


\begin{equation} \label{eq:bornApproximation_operator}
 	(\nabla^2  - k^2)\psi(\vec r) = 0.
\end{equation}

Born approximation that is used for estimating the scattering amplitude.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bornApproximation_scatteringAmplitude}
	f(\theta) =   - \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \int_{0}^{\infty} {\mathcal{F}\{V(r)\}dk}.
\end{equation}

Wavefunction ansatz with spin:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:scattering_waveFunction}
	\psi(r, \theta, \phi, \xi) = \frac{u(r)}{r} Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi) \otimes \chi(\xi).
\end{equation}


\subsection{Tunneling phenomena} \label{sub:tunnelingPhenomena}

Quantum tunneling phenomena is critical in understanding the phenomena of alpha particles decaying in the nuclei barriers. 

WKB approximation for the classical forbidden regions.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:tunneling_transmissionProbability}
	T = e^{2i\delta_l}.
\end{equation}

Ansatz: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:WKB_ansatz}
	\Psi(r) = \Psi_0\exp{(\Phi(r))}.
\end{equation}

The SchrÃ¶dinger equation transforms as 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:WKB_schrodinger}
	\left(\Phi'' + \Phi'^{2} \right)\Phi = \left(\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} (U(r) - E)\right) \Phi.
\end{equation}

Then, if it is considered that $\Phi'' \ll \Phi'^{2}$, then $\Phi$ can be directly integrated and is expressed as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:WKB_definition}
	\Phi(E) \approx -\frac{1}{\hbar}\int_{r_1}^{r_2} {\sqrt{2m(U(r)-E)}} dr,
\end{equation}

where $r_1$ and $r_2$ correspond to the lower and higher classical turning points respectively. In this opportunity, the negative choice for the square root was taken in order to account for the fact that the probability of transmission decreases within the non-classical region.

More information in \cite{newton_2002}.

\subsection{Perturbation theory}\label{sub:perturbationTheory}

Despite the existence of exact solutions on various systems in quantum mechanics, it is more frequent to find that the solution of an arbitrary system is not expressible in a closed form. Particularly, given that an exact form for the nuclear force is almost unknown, finding exactly solvable systems in nuclear physics is an nonviable task. \\

Perturbation theory presents a handy framework for simplifying the computations when multiple interaction are present in the Hamiltonian, which can be expressed as: \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:perturbationTheory_hamiltonian}
	H = H_0 + \lambda \delta H,
\end{equation}

where $H_0$ and $\delta H$ are the known and unknown Hamiltonians respectively. In addition, there is a parameter $\lambda$, with $0 \le \lambda \le 1$, which is introduced to parametrize the perturbation. \\

Therefore, approximation methods provide the key for finding solutions in nuclear physics are required to a precision degree. For example, 

are heavily restricted  involve the n  general rule due to the complexity of the nuclear interaction interactions that they involve. In order to overcome this, some approximation methods are introduced.

In particular, it is desirable that methods ca 


hich are based on perturbation theory, which can be regarded as perturbative methods, express   in order to find the solution of complex Hamiltonian with the basis of an initial known solutions.

General definition of the perturbed Hamiltonian.



Energy shifts and state shifts. 

There are two main approaches: 

Time-independent perturbation theory.\\

Time-dependent perturbation theory.\\

Perturbation theory is involved in the calculation of cross sections and reaction rates.

An application of perturbation theory is the Fermi Golden rule for transition decay rates. 

Electromagnetic transitions are also modeled as perturbations. In this case, the perturbed Hamiltonian is proportional to an electromagnetic wave oscillating term as it is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:perturbationTheory_radiativeTransition}
	\delta H \propto \cos(\omega t).
\end{equation}

Then, time-dependent perturbation theory calculations shall proceed by calculating the matrix elements associated with the perturbed contribution to the Hamiltonian. In particular, the transition goes from a bounded state $\phi_b$ to a  continuum state $\phi_c$.  \\

Initially, the elements $\langle \phi_b | \delta H| \phi_c \rangle$ are calculated by integration. However, some terms of the transition matrix are anticipated to vanish due to the existence of symmetries in the potential. This convenient cancellation of some terms in the matrix imply that some transitions are forbidden. Then, the allowed transitions must obey certain rules which are related as transition rules. \\

Another noticeable application of perturbation theory in nuclear physics is in the calculation of the spin orbit coupling. It turns out that this perturbation is essential in nuclear structure determination, as well as in reactions involving effective potentials. \\

The perturbed Hamiltonian associated with this interaction contains a coupling term which relates the orbital  $\vec L$ and spin $\vec S$ angular momentum operator with the form:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:perturbationTheory_spinOrbit}
	\delta H_{\mathrm{SO}} \propto r^{-3} (\vec L \cdot \vec S).
\end{equation}

Cross section dependence on transition elements.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:perturbationTheory_crossSection}
	\sigma \propto |\langle k | \delta H|m \rangle|^2
\end{equation}

The changes of state that nuclei exhibit obey certain rules. In particular, this selection rules consider angular momentum conservation. An illustration is given in Figure \ref{fig:radiativeEMTransition}. \\

\subsection{Angular momentum}  \label{sub:quantumAngularMomentum}

Angular momentum is an relevant conserved quantity in physics, in particular in nuclear reactions.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:angularMomentum_definition}
	J = L + S.
\end{equation}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:angularMomentum_conmutation}
	[J_a, J_b]  = i \epsilon_{abc} J_c.
\end{equation}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:angularMomentum_coupledBaseExpansion}
 |JM \rangle = \sum_{J = j_1 - j_2}^{j_1 + j_2} \sum_{M = -J}^{J} {\langle j_1j_2m_1m_2 | JM \rangle  |j_1j_2m_1m_2\rangle}.
\end{equation}.



\section{Nuclear structure} \label{sec:nuclearStructure}

Nuclear structure is presented in this section.

\subsection{Nuclear models}  \label{sub:nuclearModels}

Stability depends closely on the biding energy. In particular, since the rest energy of the nucleus decreases with $B(A, Z)$, the more is the binding energy, the more stable is nucleus.

\subsubsection{Liquid drop model} \label{ssub:liquidDropModel}

A first approach when modeling the binding energy is a phenomenological model which is inspired in the physical description of a liquid drop. In particular, the predictions of the binding energies are determined by the fitting of the empirical formula: \\ 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:liquidDrop_bindingEnergy}
	B(Z,A )= a_1A - a_2A^{2/3} - a_3 \frac{Z(Z+1)}{A^{1/3}} + a_4 \frac{(A - 2Z)^2}{A}   +   a_5 A^{-1/2} \delta.
\end{equation}


However, this model does not fit accurately the binding energy of a selected nuclei which are more stable than expected from the model. In particular, it is said that the pair of number of protons and nucleons $(Z, A)$ of these nuclei are magic numbers. 


-	The more stable the nuclei, the greater the binding energy.
Binding energy is the energy difference of rest energy of the nucleus constituents and the actual  rest mass of the overall nucleus. \\


\begin{equation} \label{eq:liquidDrop_deltaFactor}
	\delta = 	\left\{\begin{array}{l}
		\begin{split}
			1, \quad & Z \ \mathrm{and} \ A \  \mathrm{even} \\ 
			-1, \quad &  Z \ \mathrm{and} \ A \  \mathrm{odd} 	\\
			0, \quad & \mathrm{otherwise}	\\
		\end{split}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Nuclear shell model}  \label{ssub:nuclearShellModel}

An alternative approach to the Liquid drop model is a model based on quantum mechanics. This model is closely related with the quantum mechanical modeling of the hydrogen atom. In particular, a great part of the nuclear shell model consists of solving Schrodinger equation which is expressed as:

Some nuclear binding energies cannot be completely reproduced by the liquid drop model. 

Nuclei with a special number of nucleons have a considerable difference between the predicted and measured values of the binding energy.

Classical examples of magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, ... 


\begin{equation} \label{eq:nuclearShell_schrodinger}
	- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \partial_{tt} \psi + V  \psi = E \psi.
\end{equation}

A nucleus is said to be magic if it has a magic number of protons or neutrons. As well, it can be regarded as double magic if the number of protons and neutrons are both magic. 

Being a magic nucleus implies having extra stability since all the shells are occupied by nuclei. 

Spin orbit coupling causes energy levels to shift. This shifting is considerable strong that the modified lines form shells of closely related energies. 

The exact number of possible states in a given shell strongly depends on the unperturbed levels, as well as the value of the total angular momentum $j$ associated to that level. 


In this case, the potential $V$ represents the effective potential of the core of the nucleus and is valid at certain radii. For example, the harmonic potential $V = m\omega^2r^2$ models effectively the system of nucleons at most regimes. \\

Spin orbit coupling rules the energy levels of the nucleons. Levels are planned to be illustrated in Figure \ref{fig.nuclerShellModelLevels}.  \\

- Nuclear shell model is based on quantum mechanics. \\
-Nuclear shell model can predict the existence of the magic numbers.

	\label{fig.nuclerShellModelLevels}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Nuclear levels and transitions}  \label{sub:nuclearLevelsTransitions}

Nuclear levels work in a similar way than atomic levels. Additionally, the are possibilities of transitions between levels.

\section{Nuclear reactions} \label{sec:nuclearReactions}

Nuclear reactions are surveyed in \cite{bertulani_2003}. \\

Direct reactions \cite{bertulani_bonaccorso_2022}. \\

A planned chart is found in Figure \ref{fig.nuclerReactionChains}.

	\input{Figures/reactionSquares.tex}
	\caption[Nuclear reactions chart]{Nuclear reactions chart (under elaboration)}
	\label{fig.nuclerReactionChains}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Classification of reactions} \label{sub:classificationReactions}

The relevant reactions for the document are:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:nuclearReaction_general}
	0 + 1 \rightarrow 2 + 3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:nuclearReaction_gammaCapture}
	\gamma + 3 \rightarrow 0 + 1
\end{equation}

Expand  on how the fusion reactions occurs, their conditions and types as well as the differentiation factors with respect to fission processes.

\subsubsection{Capture reactions} \label{ssub:captureReactions}

Also, radiative capture processes are considered at astrophysical energies. Various models could be used for determining potentials. There are clusters and potential models.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:nuclearReaction_capture}
	X + c \rightarrow  \gamma + X'.
\end{equation}

When $c$ is a proton, the reaction is called radiative proton capture \cite{brune_davids_2015}. In addition, under certain circumstances, $c$ can also be an alpha particle. 

This kind of reactions are usually slower than exchange reactions. Therefore, radiative capture reactions constrain the entire rate of the chain they belong to. For example, in the CNO cycle, the reaction rate of the cycle is given by the rate of the $\CRadiativeCapture$ reaction. \\

Radiative capture appears in various element production contexts like pp chain, CNO cycle and also in explosive environments like X-ray burst and supernovae. There is a particular importance of the reaction $\BeRadiativeCapture$ since its product is a part of the triple alpha chain, which eventually results in the production of $\mathrm{{}^{12}C}$. In turn, the last nucleus is of crucial importance to the production of heavier elements. 

\subsubsection{Exchange reactions}  \label{ssub:exchangeReactions}

Another common reaction happens when there are two reactants and two products. This process is expressed by:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:nuclearReaction_exchange}
	X +  x_1 \rightarrow x_2 + X'.
\end{equation}

A case of special interest occurs when $X$ and $X'$ are considerable heavier than $x_1$ and $x_2$ nuclei. Then, this process can be regarded as if the $x_1$ and $x_2$ nuclei where exchanged, while the heavier nucleus $X$ transforms to $X'$. \\

This reaction proceeds depending which is the heaviest nuclei. In particular, there are two main mechanisms: stripping and pickup \cite{xu_takahashi_goriely_arnould_ohta_utsunomiya_2013}.\\ 

Stripping follows when $X'$ is heavier than $X$, and therefore $x_1$ is heavier than $x_2$. The form of this process is given by:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:nuclearReaction_exchange_stripping}
	\begin{split}
		x_1		&\rightarrow x  +  x_2 \\
		X + x 	&\rightarrow X'.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, pickup  occurs when $X$ is heavier than $X'$, and thus $x_2$ is heavier than $x_1$. This channel proceeds like:
 
 \begin{equation}  \label{eq:nuclearReaction_exchange_pickup}
 	\begin{split}
 		X 			&\rightarrow x + X' \\
 		x_1 + x  &\rightarrow x_2.
 	\end{split}
 \end{equation}

It is essential to be noticed that both reactions follow a two step process. The first step consists of a decay reaction with the particularity that it produces the nucleus $x$, which serves as a reactant in the following merging reaction. Ultimately, since $x$ appears in both sides on the two possible processes,  it is not distinguished neither as a product nor as a reactant in the simplified form of the exchange reaction of equation \ref{eq:nuclearReaction_exchange}. \\

A development on the $\mathrm{(p,n)}$ reaction kind is given by (Distorted wave Born approximation DWBA model) \cite{whitehead_poxon-pearson_nunes_potel_2022} and for the $\mathrm{(n,p)}$ in (Weisskpf-Ewing) deformation without spin description \cite{sharma_gandhi_kumar_2022}. \\

$\ddexchange$ is an example of an exchange reaction relevant for BBN and pp-chain nucleosynthesis. 


\subsubsection{Fusion reactions} \label{ssub:fusionReactions}

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:nuclearReaction_fusion}
	X + X \rightarrow a + X'.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cross sections} \label{sub:crossSections}

Cross section of a process. 
Partial and total cross sections depending on the reaction type.
Cross sections have relations with the $S$-matrix.

\subsection{Reaction rates} \label{sub:reactionRates}

The ratio that determines the quantity of a nucleus.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:reactionRate_generic}
	r = N \langle \sigma (v) \rangle v. 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:reactionRate_definition}
	r = A \int_0^{\infty} { E \sigma(E) \exp\left({-\frac{E}{kT}}\right)  dE}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:maxwellBoltzmann}
	P(v)dv \propto v^2 \exp{\left({\frac{mv^2}{2kT}}\right)}dv.
\end{equation}

On specifying the rates, it is needed to be considered.

Reaction rates are considered from calculation of transmitted, incident and interacting 
- Reaction rate depends on the density of particles, the velocity and the cross section
-	It is averaged by a convenient distribution. (Maxwell-Boltzman for fermions, Bose Einstein (Planck) for photons)
-	With the rates, abundance evolution is determined 

 For particles of matter, the statistics at the star fusing scale is Maxwell - Boltzmann and for photons the Bose - Einstein statistics. \\ 

There are extensions to the Maxwell-Boltzmann treatment. For example, more general distribution functions are used such as the Tsallis statistics \cite{haubold_kumar_2008}. 

There are broad classification of reactions. 

\section{The Astrophysical S-factor} \label{sec:sFactor}

Cross section does not count for the low-energy behavior. Then, additional factors can be obtained. For example, S-factor.
\subsection{Definition} \label{sub:sfactorMotivationDefinition}

There are S factors associated with the energy and they are the path to determine the nature of the potential, which is not necessarily a Yukawa potential.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:sfactor_definition}
	S(E) = E \exp({2\pi\eta}) \sigma({E}).
\end{equation} % ISBN 978-0-521-85635-5.

It is directly proportional to the microscopic cross section of the process $\sigma(E)$ and it represents the rate of a certain nuclear reaction.  \\
In particular, the astrophysical S-factor 	scales the cross section with a factor proportional to the Coloumb repulsion. 

The $\nu$ factor is defined as 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:sfactor_sommerfeld}
	\eta = \frac{Z_1Z_2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar v}
\end{equation}

where $v$ corresponds to the relative speed between the reactants. At the same time, this speed can be expressed in terms of $E$ as given by: \\

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sfactor_speed}
	v = \sqrt{\frac{2E}{\mu}},
\end{equation} 

where $\mu$ corresponds to the reduced mass of the reactant nuclei. 

There is a strong relation of the astrophysical $S$ factor with the center of mass energy. 

Usually this relation depends on the square of the energy of the center of mass $E_{\mathrm{cm}}$. \\

There are topics that are relevant in the frontiers of nuclear astrophysics  \cite{bertulani_kajino_2016} (classification with all the nuclear astrophysics environments). 

\subsection{General applications} \label{sub:sfactorApplications}

Cross section extrapolation to low energies

Reaction rates and element abundance estimations. 

\chapter{Reactions of astrophysical interest}  \label{ch:reactionsInterest}

Nuclear reactions are part of the core of nuclear astrophysics. They are accountable for the production mechanism of elements in several astrophysical environments where thermonuclear reactions can occur. In particular, there are specially relevant reactions for the explanation of the abundance of elements. For example, some of these reactions are part of critical fusion chains of stars, have challenging extrapolation techniques to low energies, or  exhibit exotic underling physical phenomena.   \\

In this section, a relevant selection of reactions types of will be reviewed.  Several reaction kinds and models are given and the classification of potential, R-matrix and microscopical models are illustrated in \cite{descouvemont_2020}.



\section{Big Bang nucleosynthesis} \label{sec:BBN}

Primordial reactions that where expected to happen just after the Big Bang occurred. For example:

Seconds to minutes after the Big Bang. 

Neutron and proton stability difference. Neutrons are unstable.  Shift towards protons permits fusion. 

Two conditions: the feasibility to fuse and the disintegration stability.

Balance between photons and baryons. If photons density exceeds too much the number of baryons, disintegration dominates. 

Deuterium is the first nuclear fusion product, since it  consists of a proton and a neutron. began to fuse when photons had  energy lower than the binding energy of deuterium nuclei. 

Relaxation times and deuterium fusion possibility. Eventually, Universe cooling inhibited additional fusion. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_2Hpradiative}
	\mathrm{{}^{2}H + p \rightarrow \gamma + {}^{3}H}.
\end{equation}

BBN description \cite{coc_vangioni_2010}
Review \cite{patrignani_et_particle-data-group_2016}.

Elements very high temperatures \cite{wagoner_fowler_hoyle_1967}

Even CNO elements can be produced via BBN nucleosynthesis under specific conditions \cite{su-qing_kai-su_yong-shou_neng-chuan_zhi-hong_2010}.

Unlike other abundances of lighter elements, lithium abundance is not well explained by Standard Big Bang theory \cite{bertulani_2019}. 


\section{Stellar fusion}  \label{sec:StellarFusion}

Much after the Big Bang, stars are formed. The high temperature and density enviornment of the core of stars allows the activation of various fusion reactions. 

Stellar stability is the result of the hydrostatic equilibrium established by the compensation compressing gravitational effect with the repulsive radiation pressure exerted fueled by the fusion reaction produced at the core of the star. The mechanisms of heat exchange in stars are radiation and convection.

Stars evolve in a process called stellar evolution. 

The diversity of elements fusing at the core of a star heavily depends on the kind of star and the stage in the stellar evolution.  Initially, when temperature and density have reached critical values, the fusion process begins. In particular, hydrogen is the first element source of fusion reactions.

The classical treatment of fusion in stars is given by the classical \cite{burbidge_burbidge_fowler_hoyle_1957}.

Summary text with aspects of stellar evolution, degenerate stars and more \cite{kundt_2005}.

Hertzsprung-Russel diagram permits a classification of a star with respect to specific categories which are related to different evolution stages in the lifetime of a star \cite{arsentieva_shevchenko_2021}.

Introduce the needed conditions for the creation of stars in the primordial nebula.
Describe how the hydrogen is burnt in the star's core and the associated products. 


Explain the required conditions that permits nuclear fusion in the star's nucleus.

\subsection{Light heavy nuclei reactions} \label{sub:lightReactions}

\subsubsection{pp chain}

Much of the initial fusion at the core of a great extent of lifetimes of main branch stars like the sun consist on hydrogen fusion reactions.The interactions of pp-chain processes are mostly electromagnetic and strong force with additional weak force mediated reactions. In addition, reaction rates of nuclear fusion processes depend on the interaction cross section and the abundance of the reactant nuclei. 

pp chain review \cite{fowler_1958}.

The main reaction in which this process occurs is: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_ppMain}
	p + p \rightarrow d + e^{+} + \nu_e.
\end{equation}

Then, when deuterium is available, there is the possibility of production of tritium $t$, which is a name for the  $\mathrm{{}^{4}He}$ nucleus,  in a reaction of the form:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_2Hdn3He}
	d + d  \rightarrow n + {}^{3} \mathrm{He}.
\end{equation}

Alternatively, another tritium producing  fusion reaction involving deuterium fusion is given by:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:reaction_2Hdpt}
	d + d \rightarrow p + t.
\end{equation}

Tritium production opens different branches for the pp-chain. For example, the main branch proceeds like: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_3Hep3He}
	{}^{3}\mathrm{He} +  {}^{3}\mathrm{He}  \rightarrow {}^{4}\mathrm{He} + 2p.
\end{equation}

This process in known as the pp1 chain. On the other hand, a more unlike second branch named pp-II follows as :

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_3HepChain}
	{}^{3}\mathrm{He} + p \rightarrow {}^{4}\mathrm{Li} + \gamma \rightarrow {}^{4}\mathrm{He} + e^{+} +  \nu_e + \gamma.
\end{equation}

This process is unlikely because of the instability of  ${}^{4}\mathrm{Li}$, which decays to ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$.

Lastly, an additional third branch is yet possible called pp-III given by: 

As it is seen in the previous reactions, this chain ends with the production of $\mathrm{{}^{4}He}$. The chain stops here because this is the most stable nucleus of the light nuclei class. Additionally, this resulting nucleus is a relevant source of the production of heavier nuclei, in particular of the triple alpha process reactions.

Additionally, screening effect present in light weight nuclear reactions \cite{raiola_migliardi_gyurky_aliotta_formicola_bonetti_broggini_campajola_corvisiero_costantini_et_2002} and a review of screening effect \cite{assenbaum_langanke_rolfs_1987}.

\subsubsection{Triple alpha process}

When $\mathrm{{}^{4}He}$ abundance, as well as temperature and density conditions are sufficient enough to fuse helium, the triple alpha process takes place. This conditions are not necessarily reached in all stars. In fact, the sun reaches this process at the last period of its lifetime.  

Triple - alpha process review \cite{coc_2012}.

The process is called triple alpha because it consist of three reactions involving $\alpha$ particles, which are equivalent to  $\mathrm{{}^{4}He}$ nuclei. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reaction_tripleAlpha_1}
	\mathrm{{}^{4}He + {}^{4}He \rightarrow  \gamma  + {}^{8}B }
\end{equation}

The next instance:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reaction_tripleAlpha_2}
	\mathrm{{}^{8}B+ {}^{4}He \rightarrow  \gamma + {}^{12}C}. 
\end{equation}

Finally, 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reaction_tripleAlpha_3}
	\mathrm{{}^{12}C + {}^{4}He \rightarrow \gamma + {}^{16}O}.
\end{equation}

The resulting nuclei of this process is $\mathrm{{}^{16}O}$, which is a very stable nuclei since it is double magic. This reaction completes with the production of another stable nuclei like $\mathrm{{}^{12}C}$. These two nuclei will have a substantial role in the production of heavier elements at the last stages of giant stars.

\subsection{CNO cycle}  \label{sub:CNOCycle}

When the star has capacity of completing the triple alpha process, their subproducts are available for additional nuclear reactions. In particular, with the presence of $\mathrm{{}^{12}C}$ nuclei, a series of capture reactions take place. These reactions will form cycles.

CNO cycle reactions \cite{wiescher_gorres_schatz_1999}.

 The first cycle reactants include carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotopes. The reaction proceeds as:  

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_CNO_C}
	\mathrm{{}_{6}^{12}C  \rightarrow {}^{13}_{7}N  \rightarrow {}^{13}_{6}C  \rightarrow {}^{14}_{7}N  \rightarrow {}^{15}_{8}O  \rightarrow {}^{15}_{7}N \rightarrow {}^{12}_{6}C  }.
\end{equation}



The last cycle fuels another nuclear capture cycle. In this case, the starting point are $\mathrm{{}^{15}N}$ nuclei and the cycle also involve oxygen and fluorine isotopes. In particular, the cycle is given explicitly by the reaction chain: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_CNO_N}
	\mathrm{{}_{7}^{15}N  \rightarrow {}^{16}_{8}O  \rightarrow {}^{17}_{9}F  \rightarrow {}^{17}_{8}O  \rightarrow {}^{14}_{7}N  \rightarrow {}^{15}_{8}O \rightarrow {}^{15}_{7}N  }.
\end{equation}

There is even a third CNO cycle, which is far more uncommon and there fore is considerably ess dominant than the second and first CNO cycle. In this case, the process is given by: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_CNO_O}
	\mathrm{{}_{8}^{17}O  \rightarrow {}^{18}_{9}F  \rightarrow {}^{19}_{10}Ne  \rightarrow {}^{19}_{9}F  \rightarrow {}^{16}_{8}O  \rightarrow {}^{17}_{9}F \rightarrow {}^{15}_{8}O  }.
\end{equation}

The last three processes are summarized in the illustration of Figure \ref{fig:CNOcyles}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{Figures/CNO.tex}
	\caption[CNO I, II and III cycles representations]{CNO I, II and III cycles representations. Notice how the byproducts of the preceding cycles are sources of the next cycle. This figure is under elaboration.}
	\label{fig:CNOcyles}
\end{figure}

Notice that the cycle balance is established by the existence of proton capture and beta decay, which increases and decreases the atomic mass respectively. Then, any change in the rates of the previous reactions would alter the possiblity of production of certain elements. In particular, at high enough temperatures, the rate of the proton capture process surpass that of the beta capture. Then, alternative products are produced and new processes form what is called hot CNO cycles.  

Further cycles related to alpha reactions Ne cycle \cite{kaeppeler_wiescher_giesen_goerres_baraffe_eleid_raiteri_busso_gallino_limongi_et_1994}

There are more cycles of capture reaction. An example regarding the MgAl cycle is given in \cite{lotay_doherty_janssens_seweryniak_albers_almaraz-calderon_carpenter_champagne_chiara_hoffman_et_2022}.


\subsection{Medium heavy fusion reactions} \label{sub:mediumHeavyReactions}

At a certain moment, the core of big stars starts to contract. Then, various middle heavy elements start to be consumed by the star. These reactions concern nuclei with $A < 28$. Classical burning processes include carbon, neon, oxygen and silicon, as well as a whole new variety of processes are allowed given the appropriate conditions at the last period of the lifetime of the star. 

Examples of this kind of reaction include the $\mathrm{{}^{12}C + {}^{12}C}$,   and the  $\mathrm{{}^{16}O + {}^{16}O}$ fusion reactions.   Most of these reactions result in different channels. 
 
With respect to the carbon fusion reaction, which is the starting reaction,  the principal channel is given by: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_C12fusion_alpha20Ne}
	\mathrm{{}^{12}C + {}^{12}C \rightarrow {}^{4}He + {}^{20}Ne}. 
\end{equation}

Additionally, carbon burning contributes to heavy nuclei production as being a source neutrons. In particular, the process that allows this production is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_C12fusion_n23Mg}
	\mathrm{{}^{12}C + {}^{12}C \rightarrow n  + {}^{23}Mg}. 
\end{equation}

Later, oxygen burning starts are very high temperatures and pressures than the neon and carbon burning due to the high stability of oxygen nuclei. In fact, oxygen nucleus is double magic.The main channel of the oxygen fusion reaction occurs in the following manner:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_O12fusion_alpha28Si}
	\mathrm{{}^{16}O + {}^{16}O \rightarrow {}^{4}He + {}^{28}Si}. 
\end{equation}

The neutron producing channel related to oxygen burning, which is analogous to the reaction of Equation \ref{eq:reaction_C12fusion_n23Mg}, proceeds as: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_O12fusion_n31S}
	\mathrm{{}^{16}O + {}^{16}O \rightarrow n + {}^{31}S}. 
\end{equation}

Actually, there are more carbon and oxygen fusion channels than the previously mentioned. Further channels are visualized in the reaction bifurcations which are presented in Figure \ref{fig:COchannels}.


\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{Figures/Ochannels.tex}
	\caption[Carbon and oxygen burning main channels.]{Reaction chart of carbon and oxygen burning main channels.}
	\label{fig:COchannels}
\end{figure}


Additionally, there are reactions with the both carbon and oxygen as reactants. The $\mathrm{{}^{12}C + {}^{16}O}$ is an example of this kind of processes. 

Reactions are not limited to ground state reactants. In fact, there are inelastic channels associated with $\mathrm{{}^{16}O}$ which could increase the probability of occurrence for the overall reactions.  \\

Additionally, neon burning stats by fusing with $\mathrm{{}^{4}He}$ nuclei to produce heavier elements.

 Neon burning \cite{arnett_1974}.

Fusion up to oxygen \cite{eleid_meyer_the_2004}.

There is a silicon burning process with the following description 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_28Sialpha}
	\mathrm{{}^{28}_{14}Si +{}^{4}_{2}He \rightarrow {}^{32}_{16}S}.
\end{equation}

Silicon burning is another process that closes the middle heavy burning. Silicon burning \cite{bodansky_clayton_fowler_1968}.  An example of a channel of the fusion reaction is given by:


\begin{equation} \label{eq:reaction_28Sifusion_alpha56Fe}
	\mathrm{{}^{28}Si + {}^{28}Si \rightarrow {}^{4}He + {}^{56}Fe }.
\end{equation}

The burning processes does not continue further since $\mathrm{^{56}Fe }$ is one of the most stable of the whole list of nuclei. Then, as it is explained in the next section, alternative fusion process would need to occur to increment the mass of the resulting nuclei.

$\Cfusion$ nucleosynthesis in massive stars \cite{pignatari_hirschi_wiescher_gallino_bennett_beard_fryer_herwig_rockefeller_timmes_et_2012}. $\Cfusion$ is a source of $\alpha$, $n$ and $p$ nuclei that are sources of further process, namely alpha capture, r-process and s-process respectively. 
This reaction plays important roles on other processes and depends heavily on temperature.

\section{Heavy nuclei reactions } \label{sec:heavyReactions}

Explain the different chains going on during the carbon-oxygen combustion to heavier elements like iron or silicon.

Additional fusion reactions with nuclei with $A > 28$ are present at the last stages of the life of a star. There are two main environments: The stellar fusion and explosive events fusion.

heavy-ion reactions + coupled channels + low-energy cross section enhancements  + parameter free SÃ£o Paulo potential + zero point motion (ZPM) + vibrational couplings + WKB approximation for nondeformed potential  + nuclei deformation \cite{nobre_chamon_gasques_carlson_thompson_2007}

\subsection{Supernovae and other explosive environments} \label{sub:explosive}

This reaction is essential since the $\mathrm{{}^{56}Fe}$ nucleus has the maximum binding energy. Then, fusion reactions of heavier nuclei tend to be less spontaneous.Then,  this chain of reactions continues until the process in there 56-Ni is reached.

\subsection{Alpha reactions} \label{sub:alphaProcesses}

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:reaction_52Fealpha}
	\mathrm{{}^{52}_{26}Fe +{}^{4}_{2}He \rightarrow {}^{56}_{28}Ni}.
\end{equation}

Alpha and cluster decay \cite{maroufi_dehghani_alavi_2019}.

Alpha induced reactions \cite{le_duy_hung_2021}.


\subsection{The s and r processes} \label{sub:srProcesses}

There exists the s and  the r processes. Each permits to form heavier nuclear elements products. Now, there are aspects of the particularities of the production of the nuclei that  are currently  unknown \\

On the other hand, protons are captured at the ending of the life of a gigantic star. This process, which occurs at high densities and temperatures, is referred as proton capture. In particular, under astrophysical scenarios like supernovas, the rapid proton capture, in addition to the neutron capture,  produces a considerable amount of the heavy nuclei. This process is referred as rapid proton capture, or rp process. \\ 

Further processes are not viable because they are not exothermic and potential heavier nuclei than 56-Ni are photodisintegrated. At this scale of energy, nuclear reactions start to behave similarly than chemical equilibrium reactions. 

The conditions are associated with the mass. Particularly, depending on the mass regime, star evolution can differentiate. For instance, there are brown dwarfs, sun like stars. \\

There is an evolution process that is ruled by different instances. Each instance can be regarded as a region in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This diagram consists of a two dimensional scatter plot of the intensity with respect to the spectral type of a star. Particularly, there are regions associated to the different instances of the life of a star: Main sequence (Hydrogen burning stars), red stars, neutron stars, supernova of kinds Ia Ib and other instances. \\

Electron degeneracy prevents the white dwarf to collapse and the neutron degeneracy pressure prevents the neutron star to collapse. These limits account for relativistic Fermi gas and neutron degeneracy with a model from general relativity. \\

Indicate that there exists different channels of production depending on the existence of neutron capture or fission products. Additionally, explain the needed conditions in order to those processes to occur. \\ 

If mass increases further, there is no place to any degeneracy compensation so the star would collapse to a black hole.

\chapter{Astrophysical S-factor models} \label{ch:sfactorModels}

There are several methods for estimating the astrophysical S-factor. Each method is more convenient depending on the nature of the reaction. For example, method accuracy can vary depending on  the reaction type or the existence of resonant phenomena. Additionally, the methods are based on a specific approach when modeling the S-factors. In this section, the principal methods of estimating the astrophysical S-factors will be reviewed.

\section{Microscopic models} \label{sec:microscopicalModels}

Microscopic models are based on first principles and usually require assumptions about the nucleus and its structure. \\ 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:micro_hamiltonian}
	H = \sum_{k} T_k + \sum_{k} V_k (r) + \sum_{k \neq j} V_{kj}(r).
\end{equation}

Modern theories \textit{ab initio} electroweak reactions  (correlated spherical harmonics and variational Monte Carlo method) \cite{marcucci_nollett_schiavilla_wiringa_2006}

\subsection{\textit{Ab initio} models} \label{sub:microscopical_abinitio}

These models start from first principles without prior empirical or phenomenological assumptions. 
On the other hand, clusters consider the system of interactant nuclei as a whole. In particular, there are models based on \textit{ab initio} assumptions about a particular set of nuclei.  \\

\subsection{Many body models}  \label{sub:microscopical_manybody}

The nucleus can be modeled as a many body system. Naturally, the nucleons are the components of this bounded system. In addition, the interactions between the components of the nucleus are nuclear interactions of a certain shape and form.  \\


   These models take into account the different bodies that make up the nuclei. \\

Therefore,  cross section determination is reduced to the analysis of a many body quantum mechanics problem with all the nuclear compounds. \\

Multi-body calculations.  Non-local calculations. \\

Also, nuclei deformation can be considered in models. For example, there are models with no-core shell. \\

\subsection{Cluster models} \label{sub:microscopical_cluster}

Despite the fact that many body microscopical models are general enough to explain many kinds of nuclear phenomena, calculations may be complex to perform as the number of nucleons growth. Therefore, in order to tackle the complexity issue, physically consistent models with less constituents are needed. \\

One proposal for reducing the number of entities is to model the nucleus as a bounded system of clusters. A cluster is a selected subsystem usually composed by more than one nucleon. Then, the nucleus at large is represented by the resulting cover of all of its clusters.   \\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{Figures/cluster.tex}
	\caption[Clustered $\mathrm{{}^{6}Li}$ nucleus]{Artistic representation of a clustered $\mathrm{{}^{6}Li}$ nucleus. The nucleus covers a two cluster system with an $\alpha$ particle and a deuterium as its constituencies.  }
	\label{fig:microscopical_cluster}
\end{figure}


An example of clustering is given with the $\mathrm{{}^{6}Li}$ nucleus depicted in Figure \ref{fig:microscopical_cluster}. With this picture, it is observed how the number of interacting bodies has decreased from 6 nucleons to 2 clusters: the  $\mathrm{{}^{4}He}$ and deuterium nucleus.  \\

Additionally, it is said that the $\alpha$ particle and the deuterium nucleus are the core and the valence clusters respectively. This classification is analogous to the core and valence electrons used in atomic physics. In particular, the core corresponds to the $\alpha$ particle cluster since it has more nucleons than the valence cluster which is the $d$ nucleus.  \\

On the other hand, in order to give this kind of models physical significance, selected interactions between clusters are introduced. The $NN$ and $NNN$ forces are standard examples of such needed interactions. In addition, since the constituents usually have many nucleons, extended object parameters like mass and charge density distributions may be encountered. \\

The mass and nuclear density of the nuclei can be modeled as a Woods-Saxon distribution as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:micro_density}
	\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + \exp{\left(\frac{r - R}{a}\right)}}.
\end{equation} 

With folding.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:micro_folding}
	\int \int \rho(r_1) \rho(r_2) dr_1 dr_2. 
\end{equation}

\section{Matrix models}  \label{sec:matrixModels}

The matrix models permit the modeling of resonances with an appropriate fitting of free parameters. In particular, the main formalism in this approach is the R-matrix model \cite{lane_thomas_1958} and a more recent review \cite{descouvemont_baye_2010}. \\

On the other hand, there are matrix models with no free parameters. For example, the K-matrix model predicts the cross sections without including the channel radius, which is an arbitrary parameter required in the R-matrix calculations \cite{humblet_1990}. \\

This method is also compatible with the Trojan hourse method subbarrier thresholds \cite{mukhamedzhanov_shubhchintak_bertulani_2017}. \\

Finally, there is more than a single parametrization for matrix models \cite{brune_2002}. Usually the alternative formulations surge from the need to express the parameters of the model in order to facilitate the imposition of boundary conditions.  



\subsection{Calculable R-matrix} \label{sub:rmatrix_calculable}

The model includes free parameter $a$ which is called the radius channel. \\

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:rmatrix_elements}
	R_{cc'} = \sum_k {\frac{\gamma_{ck} \gamma_{c'k}}{E - E_k}}.
\end{equation}

$a$ is a free parameter. 

$\gamma$, $E_k$ free or not free parameters* 
Guess: They can be deduced from calculable R-matrix
but fitted with phenomenological R-matrix

Picture A: Scattering picture ?
	-	Potential 
	-	Microscopical ...
	
Picture B: Phenomenological by fitting 
	-	 Raw fitting 
	-	R-matrix more sophisticated 

Matrix

R-matrix has a connection with the collision matrix, which is closely related with the S-matrix. 

S-matrix has already a connection with cross section. 

With the difference that $a$ plays some role here. 

Channels unified parts with different contribution for a same reaction or resonances. 

Does R-matrix serve to deduce the resonant levels? 

Or a potential is needed with bounded solution to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation.  

The R-matrix approach serves as a framework for modeling several kind of reactions. 

Boundaries or not boundaries. Related with wavefunction 

Exchange reaction: (DWBA)
Proton capture reaction: (First order perturbation theory + radiative transitions + spin implementation + .. )

WKB: potential to the wave function: 

Effective field theory: Low energy $L_{QCD}$. 
QCD is SU(3). However, this is unnecessary sophisticated and effective interactions within nuclei can be introduced with fermionic fields. 

Chiral and additional topological effects to be used as the description of states.

Difference between state and element of the periodic table. A nuclear state consist of an object associated with a pair of A, Z and also  with a certain energy and additional quantum number values.

From the microscopical point of view, there are aspects of the microscopical world to reduced a N-body calculation to  clustering or molecular calculations (examples)

Guess: SU(2) of flavor might be here. Mesons can be mediators. 

The advantage is that all the quantum field theory machinery is available.

Also lattice quantum field theory could be introduced here if convenient and other stochastic methods that use, for instance, Monte Carlo methods. 

The sum is over levels and the elements are parameterized as channels.  \\

Resonances arrives from poles. Deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance prediction. A description on the physical consideration of poles in the scattering (S-matrix) is given in \cite{ramirezjimenez_kelkar_2018}. \\

Applications of the R-matrix formalism to specific reactions:

\subsection{Phenomenological R-matrix} \label{sub:rmatrix_phenomenological}

The penetration factor parameter $P(E)$ which is expressed as: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:rmatrix_penetrationFactor}
	P= \frac{\Gamma}{F_l^2 + G_l^2},
\end{equation}

where the functions $F_l = F_l(ka)$ and $G_l = G_l(ka)$ are the Coulomb functions evaluated at a particular $\rho = ka$. In addition, another parameter $Q$ is given: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:rmatrix_QFactor}
	Q = \frac{\Gamma}{F_lG_l' + G_lF_l'}.
\end{equation}

On the other hand, the phase shift is given by:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:rmatrix_phaseShift}
	\delta = \delta_{\mathrm{HS}} + \delta_R.
\end{equation}

An empirical formula obtained from the R-matrix formalism is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:rmatrix_sfactor}
	S(E) = S_r \frac{\Gamma^2/4}{(E-E_r + \Delta)^2 + (\Gamma/2)^2}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{K-matrix} \label{sub:kmatrix}

There is also the K-matrix model as an alternative of the R-matrix model \cite{humblet_1990}. The advantage of this model with respect to the R-matrix is that the K-matrix does not include the channel radius as a free parameter.  Alternative formulation of R-matrix \cite{brune_2002}.

\section{Potential models} \label{sec:potentialModels}

Nuclei are considered as objects subject to effective interactions. 

\subsection{Effective potentials} \label{sub:potential_effective}

These interactions are also modeled by effective potentials which account qualitatively for the nature of the underlying physics behind the nuclear reactions. In particular, different kind of potentials offer a particular shape of the interaction which make them suitable for the modeling of concrete reactions.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic standard potential} \label{sub:potential_effective_EM}

The effective interaction between nuclei is referred as a composite effect of the electromagnetic and nuclear interactions.  \\

The first interaction is considered due to the electromagnetic repulsion between the nuclei. In a first approach, the  substructure of the nuclei is ignored. Then, nuceli charged cloud is modeled as uniformly charged sphere. Therefore, the corresponding potential is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_EM}
	V_{\mathrm{EM}} = 	\left\{\begin{array}{l}
		\begin{split}
			\frac{Z_1Z_2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0R}\left(\frac{3}{2} - \frac{r^2}{2R^2}\right), \quad &r \le R \\ 
			\frac{Z_1Z_2e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}, \quad &r > R	
		\end{split}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Empirical potentials} \label{sub:potential_effective_empirical}

Secondly, in order to account for the nuclear force, an short-distance attractive potential is needed to be included. However, unlike the electromagnetic interaction, nuclear potentials might not be deduced  in a closed and fundamental form such as the expression given in \ref{eq:potential_EM}. Consequently, these  potentials are usually phenomenological and account for specific purposes. In fact, there is a an extent list of potentials available in literature which are used for modeling the interactions of different kind of reactions. \\

For instance, in a first approximation, there is the step potential.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_squareWell}
	V_{\mathrm{SqW}} = -V_0\theta(r).
\end{equation}

Double exponential potentials: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_doubleExponential}
	V_{\mathrm{DE}}(r) = - V_0 \left(e^{\alpha_1 r} + e^{\alpha_2 r} \right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}

Cluster potential:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_cluster}
	V_{\mathrm{CL}}(r) = - V_0 \exp{(-\alpha r^2 )} + V_1 \exp{(\beta r)}.
\end{equation}

Gaussian exponential: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_gaussianExponential}
	V_{\mathrm{GE}}(r) = - V_0 \exp{(-\alpha r^2 )}.
\end{equation}

Yukawa potential  which includes screening effect.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_Yukawa}
	V_{\mathrm{Y}} = -\frac{c}{4\pi\epsilon_0}e^{-\mu r}.
\end{equation}

Yakovlev et. al model \cite{yakovlev_beard_gasques_wiescher_2010} consists of an estimation of the potential that is similar to the parabolic potentials with free parameters that attempt to account for the effects of the nuclear and electromagnetic interactions.  \\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev}
	V_{\mathrm{YAK}} = 	\left\{\begin{array}{l}
		\begin{split}
			E_c\left(3 - \frac{r^2}{R_c^2}\right), \quad &r \le R_{c1} \\ 
			\frac{Z_1Z_2e^2}{r}, \quad &r > R_{c1}	
		\end{split}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Woods-Saxon potentials} \label{sub:potential_effective_woodsSaxon}

In order to the potential to be more realistic, a Woods-Saxon potential consider a smooth behavior.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_WoodsSaxon}
	V_{\mathrm{WS}}(r) = \frac{-V_0}{1 + \exp  \left({\frac{r-R}{a}}\right)},
\end{equation}

where $V_0$ represents the potential depth, $a$ the parametrization and $R$ a computed radius which is defined as: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_WoodsSaxon_radius}
	R = r_0(A_1^{1/3} + A_2^{1/3}).
\end{equation}

Further details about capture reactions (potential model Woods-Saxon + spin-orbit coupling + ANC + SF) with single-particle states is given by \cite{huang_bertulani_guimaraes_2010}. \\

On the other hand, it is relevant, specially at low energies, the inclusion of angular momentum effects in the potential. In order to account for that effect, there is the potential with angular moment. \\
\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_WoodsSaxon2}
	V_{\mathrm{WS}} = -V_0 f(r),
\end{equation}

Fermi-Dirac distribution like term: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:potential_WoodsSaxon2_fermiDirac}
	f(r) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp {\left(\frac{r- R}{a}\right)}}.
\end{equation}

Surface Fermi-Dirac, which is related to the derivative, is a distribution like the following term: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:potential_WoodsSaxon2_surfaceFermiDirac}
	f_{\mathrm{S}}(r) = \frac{\exp{\left(\frac{r - R}{a}\right)}}{\left(1 + \exp {\left(\frac{r- R}{a}\right)}\right)^2}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Spin orbit contribution} \label{sub:potential_effective_spinOrbit}

On the other hand, it is relevant, specially at low energies, the inclusion of angular momentum effects in the potential. In order to account for that effect, there is the potential with angular moment. \\

Also, spin orbit coupling effect is noticeable for certain kind of reactions. The contribution to the potential associated with this effect is expressed as:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:potential_spinOrbit}
	V_{\mathrm{SO}}(r) = k\langle L \cdot S \rangle  \frac{1}{m_{\pi}r} \frac{d}{dr} V(r),
\end{equation}

where the coupling  $  \langle L \cdot S \rangle$ is expressed as: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:potential_spinOrbit_LSexpansion}
	\langle L \cdot S \rangle = J(J+1) - l(l+1) - s(l+1).
\end{equation}

	V(r) = V_R(r) + iW_R(r).
\end{equation}

Optical energy dependent model (parabolic approximation with analytical cross section) \cite{singh_sukhvinder_kharab_2013B}

\subsection{Calculations}  \label{sub:potential_calculations}

The potentials just introduced are useful for the calculation of cross sections and, therefore, S-factors. The connection between potentials and cross sections depends on the kind of reaction to be modeled. In the general approach, cross sections are directly computed form wave functions,  which are numerically estimated from the numerical solution of the SchroÃ¶dinger equation. \\

\subsubsection{WKB approximation} \label{ssub:potential_calculations_WKB}

Fusion cross section calculations using the WKB approximation method are closely related with the Barrier penetration model (BPM). In this model,  the factor $\Phi(E)$, which was introduced in section \ref{sub:tunnelingPhenomena} and in equation \ref{eq:WKB_definition}, is calculated for the effective potential, which consists of the sum of the nuclear, electromagnetic and centrifugal terms. The last term is associated with an specific $l$ value. Then, it is possible to compute the transmission coefficient $T_l$ for each value of $l$ as it is given by \cite{koyuncu_soylu_2018}:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_WKB_transmission}
	T_l =  \frac{1}{1 + \exp ({\Phi(E)} )}.
\end{equation}

Subsequently, a summation over all the values of $l$ is performed until convergence is achieved. It turns out that there is a direct relation with the fusion cross section and the referred sum as it is expressed by \cite{koyuncu_soylu_2018, nobre_chamon_gasques_carlson_thompson_2007}:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_WKB_crossSection}
	\sigma = \frac{\pi}{k^2} \sum_{l}{(2l + 1)T_l},  
\end{equation}

where $k = \sqrt{2\mu E / \hbar^2}$ and $\mu$ corresponds to the reduced mass of the reactant nuclei.  \\

It is quiet remarkable that the calculation of the cross section of a sophisticated process like the fusion reaction can be reduced to a discrete sum of transmission coefficients. In fact, the expression of equation \ref{eq:potential_WKB_crossSection} does not need to take into account the outcome of the initial or final state. It also, it permits the evaluation of the cross section without considering further details about the structure of the fusing nuclei.  \\

However, the BPM has the main disadvantage that does not account for couplings that might exist among the sub components of the nuclei. In particular, this approach, at it will be detailed later in this work, lens to underestimate the cross-section values for nuclei. In order to overcome this issue, further models, like the zero point motion model (ZPM), are introduced in literature \cite{duarte_gasques_oliveira_zagatto_chamon_medina_added_seale_alcantara-nunez_rossi_et_2015, nobre_chamon_gasques_carlson_thompson_2007}.   \\  

Additionally, there are empirical alternatives to the calculation of S-factor by introducing additional free parameters. For instance, in the Yakovlev et. al potential model, the S-factor is parametrized in two regions and it uses two free parameters.  The details of this model are going to be introduces, as they given in \cite{yakovlev_beard_gasques_wiescher_2010}. 

For the first region, which consists of energies below the Coulomb barrier $E_c$, the astrophysical S-factor is estimated as:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_sfactor_belowBarrier}
	S(E) = S_0 \exp ({\Psi(E)} ),
\end{equation}

with $\Psi(E)$ defined as: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_psiWKB}
	\Psi(E) = 2\pi\eta(E) + \Phi(E),
\end{equation}

where $\eta(E)$ is the Sommerfeld parameter, and $\Phi(E)$ is the wavefunction calculated by the WKB, which is given in equation \ref{eq:WKB_definition} with $m = \mu$, where $\mu$ corresponds to the reduced mass of the colliding nuclei. Further details on the calculation of the last parameter are presented in section \ref{sub:tunnelingPhenomena}. \\

It is worth noticing that $S_0$ corresponds to a free parameter closely related with the S-factor value extrapolation at zero energy. In addition, as it happens usually to free parameters, $S_0$ is determined by fitting the model with experimental data. \\

On the other hand, for the second region, which corresponds to energies above the barrier, the S-factor is given by:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_sfactor_aboveBarrier}
	S(E) = S(0) \exp ({2\pi\eta(E)}) \sqrt{\frac{Ec}{E}} \left( 1 + \xi\frac{E - E_c}{E} \right),
\end{equation}

where $\xi$ is the other free parameter which accounts for the deviation from Coulombic behavior of the S-factor.  \\

\subsubsection{Exchange reactions} \label{ssub:potential_calculations_exchange}

The form of the reaction is $A(a, b)B$. Then, there are four interacting nuclei and two substeps that account for the global behavior of the reaction . In fact, depending on  $a$ and $b$ nuclei, there are two options the reaction to proceed \cite{xu_takahashi_goriely_arnould_ohta_utsunomiya_2013}. \\

The first option is related with $ a \rightarrow x + b$,  $A + x \rightarrow B$ and happens when $a$ is heavier than $b$. In contrast, the second option has the processes: $a + x \rightarrow b$ and $A \rightarrow B + x$, which are possible if $a$ is lighter than $b$. \\

Distorted Born wave approximation (DWBA) is privileged for exchange reaction calculations. 
 
The transition matrix is expressed as. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exchange_matrix}
	\langle  \phi_c | \frac{\phi}{r}|  \phi_c' \rangle.
\end{equation}
 
\subsubsection{Radiative capture reactions}   \label{ssub:potential_calculations_radiativeCapture}

Given that photons are emitted in these processes, it is essential to model the reaction as the composed effect of  all electromagnetic transitions going from a bounded to a continuum state.  \\

In fact, each transition is classified depending of its origin and multipolarity. The first criteria distinguish whether the transition has electric or magnetic nature. The second item is related to the order of the contribution in terms of the multipole expansion. For example, E1 corresponds to an electric transition of first, which corresponds to an electric dipole. \\

Since contributions from higher multipolarity decay more rapidly, the most important contributions to the cross section of the process are dipole radiation. Additionally, electric transitions are stronger than magnetic transition in a factor of $c^2/v^2$, which is noticeable given that energies are non-relativistic.

In addition, parity must be considered for each reactant. For example, photon has $\pi = -1$. Therefore, when electric processes are given, the product of initial $\pi_1$ and final $\pi_2$ parties must take into account whether the transition is electric or magnetic. More particularly, the referred product has the form: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:radiativeCapture_parity}
	\pi_1 \pi_2 = 	\left\{\begin{array}{l}
		\begin{split}
			(-1)^{\lambda}, \quad & \mathrm{E\lambda} \\ 
			(-1)^{\lambda + 1}, \quad & \mathrm{M\lambda}
		\end{split}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

In the last equation, $\mathrm{E\lambda}$ and $\mathrm{M\lambda}$ denote electric and magnetic transitions with multipolarity $\lambda$. \\

As it happens in all reactions, the total angular momentum is conserved. Then, all the spin, orbital and total  contributions should be considered. With this picture given, it is imperative the use of Clebsh-Gordan coefficients. \\


In the radiative capture reactions, cross sections are computed based on electromagnetic field operators as it is observed by \cite{huang_bertulani_guimaraes_2010}: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:radiativeCapture_crossSection}
	\sigma_m = \sum_{k}{\langle k | \mathcal{O} | m \rangle} C_{klm}.		
\end{equation}

It is usual that certain transitions cannot be completely described by equation \ref{eq:radiativeCapture_crossSection}. In order to account for defect, some authors introduce a new constant called spectroscopic factor for each transition such that the total cross section of the process is expressed as: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:radiativeCapture_crossSection_SF}
	\sigma = \sum_{m}{{(SF)}_m\sigma_m},		
\end{equation}

where each ${SF}_m$ correspond to the weight of the $m$th transition. \\ 

Usually, this new term is obtained by experimental fitting \cite{kabir_nabi_2021, xu_takahashi_goriely_arnould_ohta_utsunomiya_2013}. However, it is also common to find the spectroscopic factor to be set at $SF_m = 1$ for all transitions \cite{bertulani_1996}.



\subsubsection{Fusion reactions} \label{ssub:potential_calculations_fusion}

On the other hand, in certain specific cases when the expressions of the potentials are not mathematically sophisticated, approximations can be made. In particular, WKB approximation offers a comprehensive approach towards handy estimation of the cross sections. 

\subsection{Folding} \label{sub:potential_folding}

During the previous discussion, mass and charge distributions were not considered in detail. However, with nuceli with higher mass, the intrinsic distribution of the mass and charge gains relevance in the reaction cross section estimation. In particular, mass and charge is usually concentrated at the center of the nuceli and there is a sharp drop of the mentioned variables in the surrounding of the radius. \\

In order to account for this effect, an initial formula which accounts 

SÃ£o Paulo \cite{chamon_2007}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_SaoPaulo}
	V_{\mathrm{SPP}} (r) = V_{\mathrm{F}} (r)e^{-4V^2/c^2}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_SaoPaulo_speed}
	V^2 = \frac{2}{\mu} \left( E - V_{\mathrm{F}}(r) - V_{\mathrm{C}}(r) \right),
\end{equation}

where the reduced mass is $\mu$, the Coulomb potential is $V_{\mathrm{C}}(r)$ and the folding potential  $V_{\mathrm{F}}(r)$ is expressed as:


\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_SaoPaulo_folding}
	V_{\mathrm{F}}(r) = \int \int \rho_1(\vec r_1)  \rho_2(\vec r_2) \delta(\vec r - \vec r_1 +  \vec r_2) {d\vec{r}_1}  {d\vec{r}_2}.
\end{equation}

\section{Special models} \label{sec:specialModels}

Models which do not fit in the previously presented categories.

\subsection{Trojan Horse models} \label{sub:special_trojanHorse}

It occurs in a two step reaction process as expressed in:

\begin{equation}
	A + B \rightarrow a + (b + x)\rightarrow a + (c + d),
\end{equation}\label{eq: special_trojanHorse_reaction}

where the first and second steps correspond to the $A + B \rightarrow a + (b + x)$ and $b + x \rightarrow c + d$ reactions respectively. Notice that the $b$ nucleus does not appear as a final product of the reaction as it is consumed in the second step.

\subsection{Effective field theories} \label{sub:special_effectiveField}

Based on effective field theories. The general principle of these theories is that nuclear interactions correspond to low-energy approximate solutions of the physics described in quantum chromodynamics. \\

\subsection{Hybrid models} \label{sub:special_hybrid}

These models include aspect of potential, microscopical and even R-matrix models. For example, there are models with clustering and effective potentials.

\section{Empirical formulas} \label{sec:empiricalFormulas}

And some empirical formulas can be given. 

\subsection{Interpolations} \label{sub:empirical_interpolation}

Non-resonant reactions S-factors can be calculated with polynomial interpolations and fits. 

In particular, there is a polynomial expansion that is reported in literature to be useful. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:empirical_exponential}
	S(E) = \exp{(g_0 + g_1E + g_2E^2 + g_3E^3 + ...)}.
\end{equation}

Also, more generic expansions are modeled by fitting a Laurent series expansion. 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:empirical_laurent}
	S(E) =\frac{ a_{-1}}{E} + a_0 + a_1 E + a_2 E^2 + ... \ .
\end{equation}

For most of the reactions, $a_{-1} = 0$, since $S(E)$ should be smooth at very low energies. Therefore, the S-factor is  described as a Taylor series expansion.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:empirical_polynomial}
	S(E) = a_0 + a_1E + a_2 E^2 + ... \ .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fusion reactions formulas} \label{sub:empirical_fusion}

Fusion reactions, which is a more sophisticated model \cite{beard_afanasjev_chamon_gasques_wiescher_yakovlev_2010}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:empirical_yakovlev}
	S(E) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} {a_kE^k} + \left(1 + \exp{\left(1 +  \frac{E_c - E}{D}\right)}\right)^{-1} \sum_{l=0}^{M} {b_lE^l}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Resonances and composite formulas} \label{sub:empirical_resonances}

%Explain the forces and interactions going on in a star. Highlight what makes a star stable.


For resonant reactions, the Breit-Wigner formula

\begin{equation} \label{eq:empirical_breitWigner}
	S(E) = S_r \frac{\Gamma^2_r/4}{(E-E_r)^2 + (\Gamma_r/2)^2}.
\end{equation}

This formulation permits empirical formulas to add resonant terms to the non-resonant estimation. Usually the resonant terms are added to background which is fitted to a non-resonant formula. For example, consider the expression: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:empirical_hybridPolynomial}
	S(E) =  \sum _{k = 0}^{N} {a_kE^k} + \sum_{l = 1}^{M} {\frac{\Gamma_l^2/4}{(E - E_l)^2 + \Gamma_l^2/4}},
\end{equation}

Analogously, if the non-resonant term has a polynomial form, the S-factor hybrid resonant and non-resonant expansion is expressed as:

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:empirical_hybridExponential}
	S(E) =  \exp { \left( \sum _{k = 0}^{N} {a_kE^k} \right) } + \sum_{l = 1}^{M} {\frac{\Gamma_l^2/4}{(E - E_l)^2 + \Gamma_l^2/4}},
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the maximum order of the polynomial to be fitted, which accounts for the non-resonant behavior of the reaction, and $M$ represents the number resonances present in the reaction. 

Analytical formula deduction is given by \cite{kimura_bonasera_2013}. This approach is based on Gamow peak approximation with strong resonances. \\

\chapter{S-factor calculations for selected reactions} \label{ch:sfactorCalculations}

Astrophysical S-factor calculations for a selected list of reactions will be presented. The list of reactions distinguish between resonant and non-resonant reactions. Additionally, reactions from various astrophysical environments like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, pp-chain, CNO cycle and middle heavy nuclei fusion are included.  \\

Selected reactions calculations are based on specific models, which are conveniently chosen to reproduce the S-factor behavior. Particularly, since most of microscopical and R-matrix treatments require sophisticated parametrizations and imply considerable computational resources, potential models and empirical formulas are preferred as a first approximation for S-factor calculations in this work.  \\

Potential models and empirical formulas usually include free parameters. The values of these parameters are fitted to experimental data in order to obtain the error minimizing prediction. Consequently, S-factor experimental data gathering is of special concern in this work. In order to account for this need, several experimental data sources were consulted. Most of these references were extracted form databases like NACRE II \cite{xu_takahashi_goriely_arnould_ohta_utsunomiya_2013}. Further related details are given in Appendix \ref{ap:literatureData}. \\ 

With experimental data given, fitting of the S-factor values of the selected reaction follows. Details corresponding to fitting procedures are covered in Appendix \ref{ap:fitting}.  In particular, the values of the fitting parameters determined in this work are detailed in Section \ref{sec:empiricalFitting}.  \\

In order to perform the numerical computations for fits, a set of programs were written as specified in Appendix \ref{ap:codes}. The programming language used was Python \cite{rossum_drake_2009}. In addition, data management depended on Pandas \cite{mckinney_2010}, numerical computations were performed on top of subroutines from NumPy  \cite{harris_millman_vanderwalt_gommers_virtanen_cournapeau_wieser_taylor_berg_smith_et_2020}, fitting parameters were obtained with SciPy \cite{virtanen_gommers_oliphant_haberland_reddy_cournapeau_burovski_peterson_weckesser_bright_et_2020} and data was visualized with the support of Matplotlib \cite{hunter_2007}. \\

The evaluation of the models to be studied in this chapter is divided in two main parts: non-resonant and resonant reactions.  In addition, for each subsection of the chapter, calculations considerations are included. Subsequently, the results and analysis on the S-factor calculation for each  selected reaction are presented.

\section{Non-resonant reactions} \label{sec:nonResonant}

The  results produced by this work starts with the study of the background of the S-factor energy curves for the selected reactions. In particular, most of the backgrounds of reactions are modeled as having non-resonant behavior. Then, the study of non resonant reactions has priority as a first approximation to the calculation of the astrophysical S-factor. \\

The selected non-resonant reactions include light heavy nuclei exchange reaction $\mathrm{{}^{2}{H}(d,p){}^{3}{H}} $ and radiative capture reaction  $\mathrm{{}^{2}{H} (p, \gamma) {}^{3}{He}} $. The first reaction is critical for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis since it provides a way of fusing deuterium, which is essential for the production of heavier nuclei in the early universe \cite{coc_vangioni_2010}. The second reaction is a pivotal process in the pp-chain as it produces $\mathrm{{}^{3}He}$, which is a prerequisite  for producing the ending product of the chain $\mathrm{{}^{4}He}$ \cite{fowler_1958}. \\

 On the other hand, the middle heavy nuclei fusion reactions to be considered contain carbon and oxygen isotopes as reactants. These type of reactions are considered since the low-energy study of these two reactions are of recent research interest \cite{mukhamedzhanov_pang_kadyrov_2019, taniguchi_kimura_2021, torilov_maltsev_zherebchevsky_2021}. In fact, new successful models usually include aspects inherent on middle heavy nuclei like clustering \cite{assuncao_descouvemont_2016} or couplings to vibrational modes \cite{duarte_gasques_oliveira_zagatto_chamon_medina_added_seale_alcantara-nunez_rossi_et_2015}. \\
 
 Particularly, the $\Cfusion$  and $\Ofusion$ reactions are selected since they are essential for the burning process in massive stars at the end period of their lives. Additionally, the $\mathrm{{}^{12}C + {}^{16}O}$ reaction is also chosen due to the relevance of the study of the fusion of the two more stable carbon and oxygen nuclei. Lastly, other oxygen fusion channels like $\mathrm{{}^{16}O + {}^{17}O}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{16}O + {}^{18}O}$ are selected given their close relation to the $\Ofusion$ reaction, as well due to the existence of inelastic contributions corresponding to excited $\mathrm{O^{17*}}$ and $\mathrm{O^{18*}}$ nuclei \cite{thomas_chen_hinds_meredith_olson_1986}.   \\


%Microscopical and matrix model approaches are  used to be describe all the selected reactions.


%For me, writing represents discipline and creativity. And, this is a great chance to convert our ideas into products. 
%Even though some times writing was seen as an undesirable activity, specially at moments when there were deadlines or when it was asked to write about unrelated things in your life, I genuinely hope that we have found a path towards more enjoyable writing. 

% Being tested was, at some moment, my hardest pressure. I think that most of the times there was a need of making sure that everything was according to the required standards imposed by others. Then, writing was seen as a passive exercise that would happen to be useful for activities. Now, I propose that we might think writing as an active and creative exercise. To think in writing as the ultimate act of projecting your ideas as well as the deserved result of this significant project. So, this shift in the purpose of writing truly represents a step ahead for increasing our independence and for fostering our career goals.
 
 %Then, those standards that were once imposed, by what it seemed to be the external and restrictive interest of others, are converted in friendly procedures that you truly need. It is now the time to you to create the standards, which would be rather called, the guidelines and opportunities for your creations. 
 
 
\subsection{Calculation considerations} \label{sub:considerationsNonResonant}

Empirical formulas are initially considered for the light heavy S-factor description. In particular, the non-resonant part of the equations \ref{eq:empirical_hybridExponential}  and \ref{eq:empirical_hybridPolynomial} are fitted to experimental data.  \\

Fitting parameters to best describe experimental data were determined for empirical formulas. In particular, the parameters chosen minimized the chi-squared $\chi^2$ function as it is described in appendix \ref{ap:fitting}. In some cases, it was necessary to constraint the interval of validity of the parameters in order to avoid unphysical behaviour of the fittings. Further details about this constraints can be found in section \ref{sec:empiricalFitting}. \\

On the other hand, fusion reactions are described by the Yakovlev et. al empirical formula \cite{beard_afanasjev_chamon_gasques_wiescher_yakovlev_2010} and analytical potential model  \cite{yakovlev_beard_gasques_wiescher_2010}.  \\

Particularly, in the Yakovlev model, parameters are fitted as follows: The initial free parameters are $\delta$, $E_c$,  $\xi$ and $S_0$ which parametrize the nuclear-electromagnetic transition of the potential, the Coulomb barrier, the asymptotic value of the S-factor at higher energies and the low energy extrapolation of the S-factor respectively.  \\

Then, additional parameters are introduced in order to take into account the atomic and massive numbers of the colliding nuclei. For example, the Coulomb barrier like term is given in terms of a new parameter $R$ as follows:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_Ec}
	E_c = \frac{\alpha}{R},
\end{equation}

where $\alpha = \sqrt{Z_1Z_2e^2}$ and $R$ is determined in terms of the mass numbers $A_1$ and $A_2$ as well as the atomic numbers $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ of the reacting nuclei as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_R}
	R = R_0 + \Delta R_{1} |2Z_1 - A_1| + \Delta R_{2}|2Z_2 - A_2|.
\end{equation}

In particular, the parameter $R_0$ is unique for a given combination of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ values,  the parameters $\Delta R_{1}$ and $\Delta R_{2}$ are specific for each reactant nuclei. In addition, this parameter takes different values given in the following way: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_R1}
	\Delta R_1= 	\left\{\begin{array}{l}
		\begin{split}
			\Delta R_{10}, \quad & 2Z_1 \ge A_1.\\ 
			\Delta R_{11}, \quad & 2Z_1 < A_1.
		\end{split}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

Analogously, $\Delta R_2$ is determined as: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_R2}
	\Delta R_2= 	\left\{\begin{array}{l}
		\begin{split}
			\Delta R_{20}, \quad & 2Z_2 \ge A_2.\\ 
			\Delta R_{21}, \quad & 2Z_2 < A_2.
		\end{split}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

In quiet a similar manner, the $\xi$ parameter is expressed in terms of two new parameters $\xi_0$ and $\xi_1$ with the form:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:potential_Yakovlev_xi}
	\xi = 	\xi_0 + \xi_1(A_1 + A_2).
\end{equation}

Then, $\xi_0$ can be interpreted as a zero order approximation for $\xi$ while $\xi_1$ is the correction term coupled to the total mass number of the reacting nuclei. \\

The numerical values of the 9 lastly mentioned parameters are provided in the Table II contained in \cite{yakovlev_beard_gasques_wiescher_2010}. \\

Finally, although Yakovlev et. al model is used for middle-heavy fusion reactions, is not expected to work for radiative capture reactions since it predicts a decrement of the S-factor for all energies. In contrast, the S-factor increases in radiative capture reactions.  \\


\subsection{Results and analysis} \label{sub:resultsAnalysisNonResonant}

Results are given in this section regarding to the $\ddexchange$ reaction as presented in Figure \ref{fig:2H(d,p)3H}. \\ 

Initially, polynomial interpolations were calculated with orders $N = 1$ to $N = 5$ as it is visualized in Figure \ref{sfig:2H(d,p)3H-poly12345}. The generality of these fits is that the greater the polynomial order, the better the fit. In particular, the best is obtained with a polynomial of order $N = 5$.  \\

Similarly, exponential interpolations were obtained with $N$ ranging from 1 to 5. These fits are visualized in Figure \ref{sfig:2H(d,p)3H-exp12345}. Additionally, as it happens with polynomial fits, the best fit is given with $N = 5$. However, the polynomial fitting approach gives a better result than this exponential treatment. \\

In particular, this difference could be attributed to the fact that exponential fitting is more ideal when the order of magnitude varies considerably. Therefore, since the S-factor values have all roughly the same order of magnitude, the fitting capacity of the exponential function is limited. In addition, given that exponential fit leans to reproduce data with higher S-factor values, which happens because choosing to fitting better these data points will minimize the square error, the low energy entries are more sensible to errors.  \\

Additionally, it is observed that fits slightly overestimate the reaction S-factor at the lower energies of the plot. This deviation is due to the fact that values from RA02 data principally, as well as GR95 data in a minor extent, are pushing the S-factor estimations up. This S-factor increase is attributed to enhancements caused by the screening effect. A treatment of this S-factor increase is going to be treated in a moment. \\

 In fact, it is noticeable that very low energy values for the S-factor are not entirely consistent since various experiments give noticeable different values for points with similar energy. Then, an additional fifth order fit called poly5-exclude was calculated by not including disruptive data in which are included RA02 and GR95. This fit is visualized, with polynomial and exponential order five fits, in the best fit graph given in Figure \ref{sfig:2H(d,p)3H-exp5-poly5-best}.

Now, resuming the screening effect considerations, at low-energies as far as $ \mathrm{10^{-3} \ MeV}  <  E<\mathrm{10^{-2} \ MeV}$, an exponential-like damping of the S-factor is observed. In fact, this  behavior could explained due to the electron screening effect \cite{raiola_migliardi_gyurky_aliotta_formicola_bonetti_broggini_campajola_corvisiero_costantini_et_2002}. In particular, the enhancement factor $f$ for the S-factor is defined as \cite{assenbaum_langanke_rolfs_1987}: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:screening_factor}
	f = \frac{E}{E + U_e}\exp{\left(\frac{\pi \eta U_e}{E}\right)},
\end{equation}

where $E$ is the center of mass energy, $\eta$ is the Sommerfeld parameter and $U_e$ is a parameter that quantifies the degree of enhancement of the S-factor. The sharp increase of the S-factor at low energies is explained by the shielding of the Coulomb potential produced by the electron cloud that surrounds the interacting nuclei \cite{assenbaum_langanke_rolfs_1987}. In particular, this dismissal of the strength of the potential reduces the Coluomb barrier. Therefore, as the tunneling probability increases, the cross-section, and thus the S-factor, of the reaction also increases. \\

Additionally, the value of the $U_e$ parameter is usually obtained by fitting. An example of such fitting is found in the graphs of Figure \ref{fig:2H(d,p)3H-screening-exp5-poly5-exclude}.

\graph{2H(d,p)3H-screening-exp5-poly5-exclude}{Screening effect $\ddexchange$ reaction}{Polynomial fits to experimental data with screening effect. The curve labeled as screening-all-fit is obtained by fitting $U_e$ with all data points, screening-only-RA02-fit is obtained only with RA02 data,  \textit{screening-Ue-theory} is calculated with $U_e$ fixed to the value given in RA02. The poly5-exclude fit of Figure \ref{fig:2H(d,p)3H} was used as the S-factor estimation without screening of the last three curves. Additionally, the screening-RAO2 curve presents the S-factor prediction made in the RA02 paper. Further details about the fitting parameters and their values are given in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_dd_screening}.}

Initially, the RA02 calculation \cite{raiola_migliardi_gyurky_aliotta_formicola_bonetti_broggini_campajola_corvisiero_costantini_et_2002} was tested against data. This estimation is referred as RAO2-paper in the last plot. Despite the fact that this prediction is able to accurately reproduce the S-factor values of their measurements, namely those marked with the RA02 tag, it is unable to fit appropriately points with higher energies than 0.1MeV. Then, a more comprehensive fitting was needed to be introduced. 

In response to this improvement need, the poly5-exclude curve for background estimation calculated in this work was used. Then, in order to account for the screening data, the enhancement factor given in equation \ref{eq:screening_factor} was multiplied to the background estimation. In a first approach, a fitting with all data was made, which is visualized with the label screening-all-fit. However, since the S-factor prediction for the RA02 entries were improvable, a second curve was determined by only taking into account RA02 data, which is given the name of screening-only-RA02-fit. In this case, the fit appropiartely fits both the screening affected RA02 data and the remaining  background. Therefore, this result can be regarded as an improvement for the RA02 calculation. \\

Finally, as is visualized in the curve labeled as screening-Ue-theory, the S-factor background estimation calculated in this work also approximates acceptably the S-factor values with the value of the $U_e$ parameter given in the RA02 paper \cite{raiola_migliardi_gyurky_aliotta_formicola_bonetti_broggini_campajola_corvisiero_costantini_et_2002}. In particular, details regarding the determination of this parameter are encountered in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_dd_screening}. \\

The analysis now proceeds with the study of the S-factor curves related to the $\dRadiativeCapture$ presented in Figure \ref{fig:2H(p,gamma)3He}. This reaction was treated in a similar manner than previous reaction since there are polynomial and exponential fits. However, there is not a considerable screening effect caused S-factor enhancement. \\

Firstly, polynomial interpolations fits were determined. The result of this fitting is visualized in Figure \ref{sfig:2H(p,gamma)3He-poly12345-bounds}. As it happened with the polynomial fits related to the $\ddexchange$ reaction, there is a general tendency of S-factor estimation improvement with the increase of polynomial order. However, in this case the best fit occurred with $N = 4$, not with $N = 5$. \\

A possible cause of this finding can be associated with parameter overestimation. In addition, it is essential to comment that it was not possible to obtain fitting parameters without constraints, which eventually affected the least-squares optimization process. Then, it was likely that the polynomial with $N = 4$ had the necessary parameters to reproduce the S-factor results but also the sufficient number of them to not overestimate the selection of data with higher energies, as it happens with the $N = 5$ interpolation. \\

Secondly, exponential fits were calculated with results visible in Figure \ref{sfig:2H(p,gamma)3He-exp12345}. Fits approximate better to S-factor values with greater $N$. However,  in the $\dRadiativeCapture$ case, the fits do not entirely converge for low energy values. In particular, it seems that the fitting process is choosing the higher S-factor values rather than lower values for error minimizing. Then, it is more complex to this empirical formula to account for low energy data. This reasoning is similar to those made when commenting the exponential fits of the $\ddexchange$ reaction. \\

Lastly, selected fits are zoomed in as it is shown in Figure \ref{sfig:2H(p,gamma)3He-selected-exp5-poly45}. Given the comparison of the fits, it follows that the most robust is given by the fourth order polynomial interpolation.

With respect to middle heavy nuclei fusion reactions, the Yakovlev et al. model of \cite{yakovlev_beard_gasques_wiescher_2010} is considered as the analytical model. In addition, Beard and collaborators, in which Yakovlev is included, present an empirical formula useful to reproduce middle heavy fusion behavior \cite{beard_afanasjev_chamon_gasques_wiescher_yakovlev_2010} is also used. \\

In this work, fits are done based on the previous empirical formula  with the advantage that parameters are determined by fitting data points directly. In contrast, both of the referenced approaches attempt to estimate SÃ£o Paulo potential model calculations which are not necessarily close to actual experimental data, specially at energies below the Coulomb barrier. \\

As a starting point, S-factor estimations for the $\Cfusion$ reaction are presented in Figure \ref{fig:12C12C} using the potential and empirical Yakovlev estimations, as well as empirical fits to equation \ref{eq:empirical_yakovlev} with $N = 3$ and $M = 2$. In addition, data survey for this reaction was concentrated at energies below the Coulomb barrier given that both of the cited models were already tested successfully at energies above the barrier against experimental data.

In addition, two empirical fittings are included. Experimental points references are presented in Table \ref{table:fusion}. Parameters related to empirical fits are given in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_12C12C}.}

It is observed that both the potential and empirical external calculations underestimate the value of S-factor. Meanwhile, the plot calculated from this work passes through most of data points. This distinction is not exclusive for the $\Cfusion$ reaction. In fact, this is a pattern present in more middle heavy fusion reactions. \\

Additionally, one of the key features of the $\Cfusion$ channel is the presence of various low-energy resonances \cite{notani_esbensen_fang_bucher_davies_jiang_lamm_lin_ma_martin_et_2012}. In fact, this resonant behavior seems to be out of the scope of the Yakovlev potential predicting capacity, as well certainly far from being taken into account with the empirical formula used.  Therefore, further predictions should be able to parametrize this resonances and to give a more accurate S-factor estimation with composite non-resonant and resonant contributions. \\

In fact, the $\mathrm{{}^{12}C + {}^{16}O}$ reaction also presents resonant peaks at energies below the Coulomb barrier as it is seen in Figure \ref{fig:12C16O} and as it is reported in literature \cite{torilov_maltsev_zherebchevsky_2021}. \\

As it happens with the $\Cfusion$ reaction, this work fit passes through most of the experimental points up to a certain energy, when there is a deviation from the main behavior of the S-factor data. In contrast, both of the Yakovlev et al. estimations underestimate the S-factor values at low energies but predict closely values at higher energies. \\

Additionally,  two empirical fittings are included. The reference for the experimental points is given in Table \ref{table:fusion}. The values of the empirical fits parameters are given in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_12C16O}.}

This difference might be explained by considering that the fittings presented in work are minimizing error by usually choosing to fit more appropriately values with higher S-factor. This bias could sufficiently explain why the accuracy of S-factor calculations decreases at energies above the Coulomb barrier. On the other hand, discrepancies between the predictions of the cited models and data are produced since they do not account for aspects inherent to the microscopical behavior of middle heavy nuclei like carbon and oxygen  \cite{duarte_gasques_oliveira_zagatto_chamon_medina_added_seale_alcantara-nunez_rossi_et_2015}. \\

In particular,  since Yakovlev et al. are based in barrier penetration models like the SÃ£o Paulo model reported in \cite{yakovlev_beard_gasques_wiescher_2010} which does not account for nuclei substructures, it underestimates the fusion cross section since this approach does not include details on the nuclei like coupling with inelastic states or the existence of screening effect S-factor enhancement \cite{koyuncu_soylu_2018}.

In a similar way, the S-factor of oxygen fusion reactions of Figure \ref{fig:Oreactions} present low-energy differences in the prediction at low energies for the referred Yakovlev et al. calculations. Then, the empirical fitting proposed in this work serves as an improvement for low energy data extrapolation. \\

With respect to the results related to the $\Ofusion[16][18]$ reaction as presented in Figure \ref{sfig:16O16O}, it is observed how the fit calculated in this work estimates appropriately the S-factor for the complete range of energies of the graph. On the other hand, as anticipated, the cited models underestimates the S-factor at energies below the Coulomb barrier. \\

Similarly, the S-factor values related to the $\Ofusion[16][17]$ reaction illustrated in Figure  \ref{sfig:16O17O} shares a similar behavior as compared to the previous reaction. However, there were not available calculations for the Beard et al. empirical formula. Additionally, both of the fits were less accurate than those presented for the $\Ofusion[16][18]$  reaction analysis. \\

This difference might be caused because of inherent aspects of the $\mathrm{{}^{17}O}$ nuclei. In particular, it is known the existence of inelastic channels related to both $\mathrm{{}^{17}O}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{18}O}$ nuclei \cite{kovar_geesaman_braid_eisen_henning_ophel_paul_rehm_sanders_sperr_et_1979}. Moreover, the fact that $\mathrm{{}^{17}O}$ has an even $A$ number could introduce more instability and potentially higher fusion capacity. \\

Finally,  $\Ofusion$ data is visualized in Figure \ref{sfig:16O18O}. As it happened to the last two reactions, the values corresponding to the S-factor are fitted better at energies below the Coulomb barrier with the empirical fit determined in this work and at energies above the barrier with the Yakovlev and collaborators potential model and empirical formula. Particularly, an entry with theoretical perdition with SÃ£o Paulo data was included in order to illustrate the closeness of the cited papers results to this theoretical calculation.

\section{Resonant reactions} \label{sec:resonant}

It is frequent to find sharp peaks in the S-factor values of some nuclear reactions. The existence of these fluctuations usually suggests the presence of resonant phenomena, which cannot be explained effectively with only background estimation. \\

In this work, the radiative capture $\mathrm{{}^{7}{Be}(p, \gamma){}^{8}{B} } $ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}{C}(p, \gamma){}^{14}{N}} $ reactions were selected. The first reaction has astrophysical relevance since it produces a tripe-alpha nuclei like $\mathrm{{}^{8}B}$ \cite{coc_2012}. The second reaction is essential in the CNO and hot CNO cycles \cite{wiescher_gorres_schatz_1999}. \\

A first approach towards the description of resonances consists of introducing a Breit-Wigner (BW) term in the S-factor calculation. In particular, the most simple estimation is given by assuming that the reaction proceeds with a single channel. Then, the astrophysical S-factor can be approximated as the expression given in equation \ref{eq:rmatrix_sfactor}. \\

In particular, each peak is characterized by additional variables like its height, width and energy center, which are referred as $S_0$, $\Gamma_r$ and $E_r$ respectively. With this new variables taken into account, the non-resonant astrophysical S-factor predictions of section \ref{sec:nonResonant} shall be modified.\\

Usually, more sophisticated treatments of resonances require more advanced approaches than bare curve fitting. For instance, the S-factor values of several radiative capture reactions can be analyzed by using the R-matrix model \cite{descouvemont_adahchour_angulo_coc_vangioni-flam_2004}. The main advantage of this approach is that resonances are intuitively included by adding parameters to the model.

\subsection{Calculation considerations} \label{sub:considerationsResonant}

The Breit-Wigner empirical formula is used for empirical fitting of the resonant part. However, not all the regions of S-factor energy curve for a reaction with resonances are going to coincide with resonant behavior. In contrast, these regions are critical in order to estimate the non-resonant background of the reaction.\\

For the purpose of this work, there are two methods for estimating this background. The first method consist of fitting a polynomial or exponential function to data including the whole dataset. This is specially convenient when resonances are narrow as compared to the total energy range like it happens in the $\BeRadiativeCapture$ reaction.  \\

On the other hand, when a resonance occupies almost all the energy range, it is better to fit the Breit-Wigner function first. Then, residuals, which are the differences between predictions and experimental values, are calculated. Ultimately, the background estimation is given by fitting the remaining residuals of the fit. An example of this approach is given in the study of the $\CRadiativeCapture$ reaction. \\

On both cases, the total S-factor is computed by summing the resonant and non-resonant contributions. This sum is consistent since the S-factor is proportional to the cross section, which are allowed to be summed. \\

Finally, for the special case of estimating the background of the reactions with polynomial functions, it is usually convenient to modify slightly the Breit-Wigner fitting function. In particular, an extra parameter $c$ related to the width is included. Then, the resonant contribution of equation \ref{eq:rmatrix_sfactor} is substituted with the expression \cite{sparta_pizzone_bertulani_hou_lamia_tumino_2020}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rmatrix_sfactor_modified}
	S(E) = S_0 \frac{c_r}{(E - E_r)^2 + \Gamma_r^2/4}. 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Results and analysis} \label{sub:resultsAnalysisResonant}

Estimation for background and resonant contributions for the $\BeRadiativeCapture$ reaction are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:7Be(p,gamma)8B-parts}. \\

In particular, in Figures \ref{sfig:7Be(p,gamma)8B-poly} and \ref{sfig:7Be(p,gamma)8B-exp} the polynomial and exponential background estimations, which were calculated in this work, are illustrated. Notice that, in contrast to the general tendency about fitting improvement with order increase reported in section \ref{sub:resultsAnalysisNonResonant}, fits with higher order present a rather nonphysical behavior at higher energies. In fact, the best fits are those with $N = 1, 2$.  \\

This difference can be also contrasted in the high values of most the errors of the parameters as $N$ increases, as it is shown in Tables \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_exp} and \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_poly}. In particular, the curves with $N = 4$ for both exponential and polynomial formulas were too deviated from S-factor data that the fitting algorithm was unable to determine errors for the parameters.   \\

This finding could be explained by considering the effect of parameter overdetermination. In particular, since low order fits are ideal enough, a further increment in the degrees of freedom of the fitting function will cause conflicts between already well determined parameters and new parameters which have a higher contribution at larger energies.  \\

Therefore, for the sake of simplicity, the selected background estimations for the $\BeRadiativeCapture$ reaction are those related with $N = 1$ order fitting formulas as it is visualized in Figure \ref{sfig:7Be(p,gamma)8B-BW-exp1-poly1}. \\

Actually, a fine splitting is observed between the exponential and polynomial fits. In particular, the exponential contribution presents slightly higher values than those calculated from the polynomial contribution. Although at this range of energies this discrepancy might not be considered as substantial, this could be of interest when extrapolating S-factor data to larger energies. In particular, it seems more plausible that the exponential fit would extrapolate better than the polynomial fit when considering the SC06 entry point at $E \approx$ 3.0MeV. \\

The references to the experimental points are given in Table \ref{table:light_resonant}. The values of the fitting parameters are found in Tables \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_poly}, \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_exp} and  \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_BW}.}

In addition, fitting parameters are found in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_composite}.}


A single resonance with a peak close to $E \approx$ 0.7 MeV is observed in Figure \ref{fig:7Be(p,gamma)8B-background-exp1-poly1}. Then, in order to describe the single resonance, a Breit-Wigner fit was performed. In particular, the fitting parameters are given in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_BW}.

However, as it is visualized in S-factor dependence, this fit does not account for the entire behavior of the experimental points far from the resonance. Consequently, there is the need of including the non-resonant part which was previously calculated. \\

Lastly, with both the resonant and non-resonant parts considered, it is possible to plot a single function estimation of the $\BeRadiativeCapture$ S-factor as it is presented in Figure \ref{fig:13C(p,gamma)14N-BW}. In order to achieve the result presented, it was needed to slightly adjust some of the parameters for the non-resonant and resonant formulas before the sum. The final values determined in this work for the resonant and non-resonant parameters are tabulated in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_BeRadiative_composite}. \\

Further details about the fitting parameters and their values are given in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_CRadiative_BW}.} 


On the other hand, with respect to the S-factor of the $\CRadiativeCapture$ reaction, a resonance with a peak close to $E\approx$  0.6 MeV is observed in Figure \ref{fig:13C(p,gamma)14N-BW}. Then, a Breit-Wigner fit was initially calculated.  \\


Despite the global correspondence between the experimental data and the predictions of the fit, the resonant behavior does not entirely explain the shape of the S-factor data. This discrepancy specially  occurs far from the resonance peak at low energies. In order to improve the prediction, the non-resonant contribution to the S-factor needs to be included. \\

In a first approach, the non-resonant background was estimated empirically with the residuals of the BW fitting In particular, the polynomial and exponential expansion was used as it is illustrated in Figures \ref{sfig:13C(p,gamma)14N-BW-residuals-poly1234} and \ref{sfig:13C(p,gamma)14N-BW-residuals-exp1234} with polynomial and exponential fits respectively.

In order to avoid unrealistic physical behavior, only fits with orders up to $N = 2$ were selected as it is shown in Figure \ref{sfig:13C(p,gamma)14N-BW-residuals-exp1-poly1}. In particular, it is visualized that the fits do not entirely account for the discrepancies between data and the BW fit. This suggests that the initial assumption of a single channel contribution for the resonance has limitations in predicting the S-factor of the $\CRadiativeCapture$ reaction. \\

The last observation is supported correspondence by comparing the joint resonant and non-resonant prediction with experimental data, both found in Figure \ref{fig:13C(p,gamma)14N-background-exp12-poly12}. Even though the S-factor estimation improved at low energies, new fits actually overestimate the  S-factor for entries with energies above the resonance peak. Additionally, the poly2 + BW fit has an unphysical stepping descent at low energies.

All the values of the parameters used are found in Table \ref{table:fitting_empirical_CRadiative_composite}.} 

This overall difference between S-factor experimental data and the prediction of the empirical formulas could be explained due to particularities of the physical phenomena underlying the $\mathrm{{}^{13}C(p, \gamma)^{14}N}$ reaction. In fact, the S-factor values presented in Figure \ref{fig:13C(p,gamma)14N-BW} corresponds to the sum of different channels associated with non-excited and excited states of  $\mathrm{{}^{14}N}$ \cite{xu_takahashi_goriely_arnould_ohta_utsunomiya_2013}. This means that the theoretical prediction should consider the transitions to all possible states of the reactants and product nuclei.

\subsection{Selected constants} \label{sub:selectedConstants}

NIST selected constants and conversion factors to convenient units. \\

The units used for calculations are those suitable for calculations of astrophysical S-factors. In particular, the unit of energy is given in mega-electronvolts (MeV), and the distances between nuclei are given in fentometers (fm), and the cross sections in barns ($\mathrm{1b = 10^{-28}cm}$). Therefore, various fundamental constant are converted to consistent units with respect to the mentioned convention as shown in the next table. \\

Some constants to be considered: $c$, $h$, $\hbar$, $m_e$, $m_p$, $m_n$. \\

In the units to be used for nuclear physics calculations: $4\pi\epsilon_0 = 1$. So, the fine structure constant is expressed as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:constants_alpha}
	\alpha = \frac{e^2}{\hbar c}.
\end{equation}

Therefore, the elementary charge is given by: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:constants_e}
	e = \sqrt{\alpha\hbar c} \approx \sqrt{1.41...} \sqrt{\mathrm{MeV \ fm}}.
\end{equation}

Masses can be expressed in terms of $\mathrm{MeV/c^2}$ or $\mathrm{MeV \ {fm}^{-2} \ s^{2}}$ depending on the context.

Tables of parameters that were chosen for the selected reactions

\chapter{Special functions} \label{ap:specialFunctions}

In this section will be encountered special functions to be used in scattering theory and solution of analytical equations.

\section{Bessel functions} \label{sec:bessel}

Differential equation, solutions, 1st and 2nd kind and some useful properties. There are standard and spherical Bessel functions. \\

The spherical functions are solutions for the differential equation:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:special_bessel_diffEquation}
	\frac{d^2x}{d\rho^2} + 2\rho \frac{dx}{d\rho} + (\rho^2 - l(l+1))x= 0.
\end{equation}

In particular, the solutions $J_l(\rho)$ and $Y_l(\rho)$ are called the Bessel and Von-Neumann solutions. One difference between these solutions is that $J_l(\rho)$ is well defined while $Y_l(\rho)$  has a pole at that $\rho = 0$.   \\

In addition, the asymptotic behavior when $\rho \rightarrow \infty$ is different for each function as shown:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:special_bessel_J}
	J_l(\rho) \rightarrow \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\pi\rho}}\cos{\left(\rho - \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{l\pi}{2}\right)}.
\end{equation}

and


\begin{equation} \label{eq:special_bessel_Y}
	Y_l(\rho) \rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi\rho}}\sin{\left(\rho - \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{l\pi}{2}\right)}.
\end{equation}


\section{Coulomb functions} \label{sec:coulomb}

Differential equations, solutions and more properties.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:special_coulomb_diffEquation}
	\frac{d^2x}{d\rho^2}+ (\rho^2 - 2\eta \rho  - l(l+1) )x= 0.
\end{equation}

There are two solutions for this equations. In the context of scattering theory, the solutions $F_{l\eta}(\rho)$ and $G_{l\eta}(\rho)$ are analogous to the  $J_l(\rho)$ and $Y_l(\rho)$ solutions of the Bessel differential equation respectively.  \\

The formulas are connected as \cite{gaspard_2018}.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:special_coulomb_connection}
	G_{l\eta} = \frac{F_{l\eta} - iF_{-l\eta} }{2i}.
\end{equation}

In a similar way than the Bessel functions, the Coulomb functions have harmonic like asymptotic behavior. In particular,  $F_{l\eta} \rightarrow \sin{\theta_{l\eta}}$ and $G_{l\eta} \rightarrow \cos{\theta_{l\eta}}$ with $\theta_{l\eta}$ defined as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:special_coulomb_theta}
	\theta_{l\eta}(\rho) = \rho -  l\frac{\pi}{2}  - \eta\ln{(2\rho)} +  \arg\Gamma(l+ 1+i\eta).
\end{equation}

\section{Additional selected functions} \label{sec:additionalFunctions}

Hypergeometric equations and connection with coulomb functions with implementation. \\

Spherical harmonics and Legendre polynomials for the expansions used in scattering theory.  Hyperspherical harmonics\\

\section{Clebsch-Gordan coefficients} \label{sec:clebschGordan}

Motivation, definition and some computations. Generalization to further spins and couplings that are useful for determining effects like the spin-orbit coupling. \\

The total angular momentum and change of basis.

Tensor products are reported as to be useful in describing generalized sums and products. For instance, the direct product is expressed.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:angularMomentum_tensorSum}
	a \otimes b.
\end{equation}

On the other hand, the direct sum is given by:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:angularMomentum_tensorProduct}
	a \oplus b.
\end{equation}

A convenient application of the last operations is encountered  within the framework of addition of angular momenta is given by the expression: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:angularMomentum_tensorProduct_addition}
	j_1 \oplus j_2 = j_1 \otimes 1 \oplus  1 \otimes j_2. 
\end{equation}

Then, the added angular momentum assumes a representation in a higher dimension. 

In addition, Clebsh-Gordan coefficients appear connected with expressions where spherical harmonics are included. For instance, the integral of a triple product of these special functions can be expressed as: 

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:angularMomentum_ClebshGordan_sphericalHarmonics}
	\int Y_l^{m} Y_{l'}^{m'}Y_{l''}^{m''} d\Omega d\Omega ' d\Omega '' = 	\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
		s &	l &	I_x \\
		j_s & j & J
	\end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
	s &	l &	I_x \\
	j_s & j & J
\end{array}\right). 
\end{equation}

Wigner symbols are introduced for expressing recurrent expressions involving Clebsh-Gordan coefficients. There are two types of such numbers: the $3j$ and the $6j$ Wigner numbers. \\

The $3j$ number is related to a single Clebsh-Gordan coefficient as it is useful for the addition of two angular momentum operators. The definition has the form: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:angularMomentum_Wigner_3j}
	\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
		s &	l &	I_x \\
		j_s & j & J
	\end{array}\right) = \frac{(-1)^{J - j_s - I_x}}{\sqrt{2l +1}}  \langle sl j_s j | I_x J \rangle.
\end{equation}

On the other hand, the $6j$ number is related to multiple  Clebsh-Gordan coefficients. In fact, this coefficient is convenient when there are three angular momentum operators adding and when a change of sub coupling is needed.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:angularMomentum_Wigner_6j}
	\left\{\begin{array}{ccc}
		s &	l &	I_x \\
		j_s & j & J
	\end{array}\right\} = (-1)^{J - j_s - I_x}  \langle s (l j_s) J | (s l) j_s J\rangle.
\end{equation}

This section is about fitting considerations on the different approaches used to calculate the astrophysical S-factor.

\section{Calculation procedures} \label{sec:calculationFitting}

Least square minimization of the quantity shown in equation \ref{eq:fitting_chiSquared}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:fitting_chiSquared}
	\chi^2  = \sum_{k=1}^{N} {\frac{(x_k - \bar x)^2}{\sigma_k^2} },
\end{equation}

where $k$ is an index running through all $N$ of the sample points, $x_k$ is the value, $\sigma_k$ is the error of each point and $\bar x$ corresponds to the average of the value taken from all points.\\

There are two process depending if the optimization is bounded or unbounded.
